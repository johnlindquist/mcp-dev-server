# CI Test Failures After Logging Refactor (2025-05-05 11:26:22)

_**User**_

Create a branch.

run `pnpm test:ci`

we recently refactored logging to always use stderr for mcp @Adjusting Log Levels for Accuracy all local tests passed, but some ci tests failed. Find the tests that failed, we _probably_ need to fix the tests because everything seems to work locally.

each time you make a fix, run `pnpm test:ci` again, if you get another test to pass, please commit

---

_**Assistant**_

```bash
git checkout -b fix/ci-logging-tests
```

```
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main) git checkout -b fix/ci-logging-tests
Switched to a new branch 'fix/ci-logging-tests'
husky - DEPRECATED

Please remove the following two lines from .husky/post-checkout:

#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

They WILL FAIL in v10.0.0

All tests have passed locally with `pnpm test:ci` on the new branch `fix/ci-logging-tests`. This suggests that the CI failures may be environment-specific or intermittent, as the recent logging changes are not causing failures locally.

**Next steps:**
- If you want to investigate further, I can help you review CI logs or add more observability to the tests.
- If you want to push this branch and trigger CI again, let me know and I’ll proceed.

Would you like to push this branch to the remote and open a pull request to re-run CI, or do you want to investigate further locally?

The root cause of the failing test is now clear:

- The test `Log Line Limit: In-Memory Purge > should only keep the most recent 50 log lines in memory` sets the environment variable `MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES=50` when spawning the server.
- However, in `src/constants/index.ts`, the `cfg.maxStoredLogLines` is always set to `1000` and does **not** read from the `MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES` environment variable.

**This means the server always keeps up to 1000 log lines in memory, regardless of the environment variable, so the test receives 125 lines instead of the expected 50.**

---

**Fix:**  
Update `src/constants/index.ts` so that `cfg.maxStoredLogLines` is set from `process.env.MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES` (defaulting to 1000 if not set).

I will make this change now.

---

```diff
  export const cfg = {
  	/** Maximum number of log lines to store in memory per process. */
- 	maxStoredLogLines: 1000,
+ 	maxStoredLogLines: Number(process.env.MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES) || 1000,
  
  	/** Default number of log lines returned by check_shell and list_shells if not specified. */
```

---

```bash
pnpm test:ci | cat
```

```

```

---

All tests now pass on the `chore/logging-lib-integration` branch after updating the code to respect the `MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES` environment variable for in-memory log line limits. The fix has been committed:

- **Commit:** `fix: respect MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES env for in-memory log line limit (fixes CI test)`

If you want to push this branch or need further actions (PR, merge, etc.), let me know!

---

_**User**_

@ci.yml Do we need to add any env vars to the CI runner?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, you **do not need to add any new environment variables to the CI runner** for the log line limit test to work.

**Reason:**  
The only test that relies on `MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES` sets this environment variable itself when spawning the server process within the test (see: `env: { ...process.env, MCP_PM_FAST: "1", MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES: "50" }`). The rest of the codebase and CI pipeline do not require this variable to be set globally.

**Summary:**  
- The CI pipeline does **not** need to set `MCP_MAX_LOG_LINES`.
- The test suite and server will continue to work as expected, because the test injects the variable as needed.

**No changes to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` are required.**

The `.only` modifier has been removed from the `protocol-safety` integration test, and the change has been pushed to the remote `chore/logging-lib-integration` branch.

**Result:**  
- All tests now pass locally.
- The branch is up to date and ready for CI to pass.
