# GitHub Push Remote Configuration Issue (2025-04-29 10:55:08)

_**User**_

The current repository does not have a push remote for johnlindquist/mcp-pm

I'm getting this warning in my GitHub extension for pull requests, even though like git and pushing branches and everything works everywhere else. Is there some configuration in my error that doesn't match up correctly with, like the remote there is the proper remote and I did rename the remote for, so there might be some git thing locally that's not named correctly anymore.

Okay, I understand. It sounds like there might be a mismatch between how your local git repository is configured and what the GitHub extension expects. Let's check your current remote configuration.

I'll run `git remote -v` to see the fetch and push URLs for your remotes.

---

```bash
git remote -v | cat
```

```
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(feat/start-process-initial-logs) git remote -v | cat
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-dev-server-demo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-dev-server-demo.git (push)
?➜  mcp-dev-server git:(feat/start-process-initial-logs)
```

---

It looks like your `origin` remote is currently pointing to `https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-dev-server-demo.git` for both fetch and push.

Is the correct repository `johnlindquist/mcp-pm` or `johnlindquist/mcp-dev-server-demo`? If it should be `mcp-pm`, we need to update the push URL for the `origin` remote.

mcp-pm, It was originally named mcpdevserverdemo, but now it's mcppm. So I think it still works for both. But yeah, let's update the remote origin.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I will update the `origin` remote URL to point to `https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm.git`.

---

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm.git
```

```
?➜  mcp-dev-server git:(feat/start-process-initial-logs) 

```

---

Now, I'll verify that the remote URL has been updated correctly.

---

```bash
git remote -v | cat
```

```
?➜  mcp-dev-server git:(feat/start-process-initial-logs) git remote -v | cat
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm.git (push)
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(feat/start-process-initial-logs)
```

---

The `origin` remote is now correctly pointing to `https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm.git` for both fetch and push. This should resolve the warning you were seeing in the GitHub extension. Please check if the warning persists.
