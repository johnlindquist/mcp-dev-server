# Biome Autofix Script Setup (2025-04-28 13:05:24)

_**User**_

@Web I just installed biome into my project. Can you set up a script that uses the biome autofix?

Okay, I can help with that.

First, I need to fix the existing formatting issues in your `package.json` file.



---

```diff
  		"prepare": "npm run build",
  		"watch": "tsc --watch",
- 		"inspector": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector build/index.js",
- 		
+ 		"inspector": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector build/index.js"
  	},
  	"dependencies": {
```

---

Now, I'll add the `lint:fix` script to your `package.json` file. This script will run `biome check --apply .` to automatically fix linting issues in your project.



---

```diff
  		"prepare": "npm run build",
  		"watch": "tsc --watch",
- 		"inspector": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector build/index.js"
+ 		"inspector": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector build/index.js",
+ 		"lint:fix": "biome check --apply ."
  	},
  	"dependencies": {
```

---

I've added the script. You can now run `pnpm lint:fix` (or `npm run lint:fix`) to automatically fix issues found by Biome.
