```
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main) git remote -v | cat
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm.git (push)
?➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main)
```

---

```bash
cd /Users/johnlindquist/dev/mcp-dev-server && git remote set-url origin https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-shell-yeah.git && git remote -v | cat
```

```
<nlindquist/mcp-shell-yeah.git && git remote -v | cat
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-shell-yeah.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-shell-yeah.git (push)
?➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main)
```

The remote URL has been updated to point to your new repository name: `johnlindquist/mcp-shell-yeah`. Both fetch and push remotes now use the correct URL.

If you need to update any other remotes or want to verify repository connectivity, let me know!
