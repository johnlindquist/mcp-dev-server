No examples were found on GitHub of people using the `composer.addfilestocomposer` command in `keybindings.json` files. This suggests that either the command is not commonly used in this context, or it may not be a standard or widely adopted command for keybindings in public repositories.

If you want to try a broader or different search (e.g., searching for just `addfilestocomposer` or for similar commands in other config files), let me know how you'd like to proceed!
