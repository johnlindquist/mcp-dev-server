# Verify JavaScript File Existence (2025-04-29 22:03:35)

_**User**_

Can you please add another step after this to verify that it's finding that JavaScript file that we're emptying to wire it to? Like, just a step that confirms that that file actually exists.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I can add a step to verify the existence of the `node-gyp.js` file after it's configured.



---

```diff
            $globalNodeModules = npm root -g
            # Tell every future npm/pnpm run to use it
-           npm config set node_gyp "$globalNodeModules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js"
-           Write-Host "node-gyp wired up at $globalNodeModules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js"
+           npm config set node_gyp "$globalNodeModules\\node-gyp\\bin\\node-gyp.js"
+           Write-Host "node-gyp wired up at $globalNodeModules\\node-gyp\\bin\\node-gyp.js"
+ 
+       - name: Verify node-gyp path
+         if: runner.os == 'Windows'
+         shell: pwsh
+         run: |
+           $globalNodeModules = npm root -g
+           $nodeGypPath = Join-Path $globalNodeModules "node-gyp\\bin\\node-gyp.js"
+           Write-Host "Checking for node-gyp at $nodeGypPath"
+           if (-not (Test-Path $nodeGypPath -PathType Leaf)) {
+             Write-Error "node-gyp.js not found at expected path: $nodeGypPath"
+             exit 1
+           }
+           Write-Host "node-gyp.js found successfully."
  
        - name: pnpm install
```

---

I've added the verification step right after the node-gyp configuration step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This step will run only on Windows and check if the `node-gyp.js` file exists at the path configured in the previous step, failing the job if it doesn't.

---

_**User**_

You’re fighting two separate things:

* **pnpm/npm always prefer their own bundled copy of `node-gyp`** unless you override a config key called **`node_gyp`**.  ([node-gyp/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md at main · nodejs/node-gyp · GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md))  
* On Windows CI the bundled copy in pnpm 10 still points at **`node-gyp 11.1.0`**, the version with the bad `GetModuleHandleW` bug.  ([Build failure on Windows in `node-gyp@11.1.0` due to ... - GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/3126?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

The fix is just to *teach the installer* where your good copy (11 .2 .0) lives.  
Below is the canonical one-liner from the official docs, wrapped in a safe GitHub-Actions step.

---

## Drop-in CI fix (PowerShell)

```yaml
# ─── BEFORE your first pnpm install ─────────────────────────
- name: Pin node-gyp 11.2.0 on Windows
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    # 1) Install the good version globally
    npm install -g node-gyp@11.2.0
    # 2) Point npm/pnpm at it (official PowerShell recipe)
    npm prefix -g | % {
      npm config set node_gyp "$_\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js"
    }
    # 3) Verify
    Write-Host "Using node-gyp at $(npm config get node_gyp)"
```

### Why this works

* The **PowerShell pipeline** above is lifted verbatim from the node-gyp docs for Windows PS.  ([node-gyp/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md at main · nodejs/node-gyp · GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md))  
* `npm config set node_gyp …` writes the path into the global `.npmrc`, so every later `npm` **and** `pnpm` command in the job reuses it.  ([node-gyp/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md at main · nodejs/node-gyp · GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md))  
* Because the fix is global, you can still use `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile`; you don’t need dev-deps present on Windows.  
* No environment variables leak into the *npm* CLI itself, so you avoid the “`node_gyp` is not a valid npm option” crash that happens when the variable name is miss-cased or double-escaped.  ([Issue after running npm install "if not defined npm_config_node_gyp"](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools/issues/227?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Could not install on windows 10 · Issue #189 · xmppo/node-expat](https://github.com/astro/node-expat/issues/189?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

---

## If you prefer an env-only workaround

Some teams don’t like touching global npm config in CI.  
You can achieve the same thing with a scoped environment variable:

```yaml
- name: Expose node-gyp via env only
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    npm install -g node-gyp@11.2.0
    $gyp = "$(npm prefix -g)\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js"
    "NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP=$gyp" >> $Env:GITHUB_ENV
```

The env-key **`NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP`** is honoured by npm/pnpm for that job only.  ([Use Native Node Modules - NW.js Documentation](https://nwjs.readthedocs.io/en/nw20/For%20Users/Advanced/Use%20Native%20Node%20Modules/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

---

## Common gotchas (checklist)

1. **Backslashes** – keep them un-escaped inside PowerShell strings (`"$path\file.js"`).  
2. **Hyphen vs underscore** – the config key is `node_gyp` (underscore), not `node-gyp`. Using the wrong form generates the *“not a valid npm option”* error you saw.  ([node.js - How to force npm to use different node-gyp version when installing packages? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70800909/how-to-force-npm-to-use-different-node-gyp-version-when-installing-packages))  
3. **Verify before install** – run `npm config get node_gyp` right after the step; it should print the absolute path inside `…\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\`.  
4. **Remember to clear** – if you ever upgrade pnpm (which will eventually ship with 11.2.0+), remove this override: `npm config delete node_gyp`.  ([node-gyp/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md at main · nodejs/node-gyp · GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md))  

Follow either snippet, keep the rest of your workflow unchanged, and the Windows job should compile `node-pty` cleanly—no patches, no downgrades, no dev-deps in production. Let me know if the next run finally turns that checkmark green!

_**Assistant**_

Okay, thank you for the detailed explanation and the corrected snippet! I understand the need to use the official PowerShell recipe from the `node-gyp` docs to correctly set the `node_gyp` config key and avoid issues with bundled versions.

I will now replace the existing `node-gyp` configuration and verification steps with the drop-in CI fix you provided.

        - name: pnpm install
```

---

I've updated the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file, replacing the previous `node-gyp` steps with the corrected PowerShell snippet you provided. This should correctly pin `node-gyp` to version 11.2.0 for the Windows runner using the official method.

---

_**User**_

**TL;DR – `npm config set node_gyp` stopped working in npm 10, so your “invalid option” error is expected.  
The two approaches that *do* work today are:**

1. **Point PNPM/NPM at the fixed copy of `node-gyp 11.2.0` with the environment variable `NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP`.**  
2. **(or) Replace the copy of `node-gyp` that lives *inside* npm itself.**  

Below are step-by-step snippets for GitHub Actions Windows runners, an explanation of why the old advice broke, plus a couple of fallback tactics.

---

## Why the old recipe blows up

* npm 10 (bundled with Node 20) no longer accepts arbitrary keys in its config; the moment you run  
  `npm config set node_gyp …` it throws **“`node_gyp` is not a valid npm option”**  ([Failed to rebuild with node-gyp@6.1.0 · Issue #2803 · nodejs/node-gyp · GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/2803)).  
* The *real* build failure you started with (`GetModuleHandleW` type-mismatch) was introduced in **node-gyp 11.1.0** and fixed in **11.2.0**  ([Build failure on Windows in `node-gyp@11.1.0` due to ... - GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/3126?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Build Failure on Windows with Node.js 22.x -- node-pty Compilation ...](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/15029?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). So we simply need npm/pnpm to run 11.2.0 instead of the 11.1.0 copy bundled inside pnpm 10.

---

## Fix #1 – use the **environment variable** (quick & reversible)

`npm_config_node_gyp` was re-enabled in early 2025 (npm/run-script #230) and *is* honoured by npm ≥ 10  ([[BUG] config var "`node-gyp`" not respected in npm 7 · Issue #2839 · npm/cli · GitHub](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2839)).

Add **one Windows-only step *before* your first `pnpm install`**:

```yaml
- name: Pin node-gyp 11.2.0 on Windows (env-based)
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    # 1) Install the fixed node-gyp globally
    npm install -g node-gyp@11.2.0
    # 2) Export the path so every later npm/pnpm call uses it
    $gyp = "$(npm prefix -g)\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js"
    echo "NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP=$gyp" | Out-File $env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
    Write-Host "Will use node-gyp at $gyp"
```

*The install scripts in `node-pty` check `if not defined npm_config_node_gyp … else …` ; once the env-var is present they jump straight to the good binary*  ([npm_config_node_gyp should be working with node-gyp.cmd on ...](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/14543?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
No other lines in your workflow need to change, and `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` will now compile without error.

---

## Fix #2 – patch npm’s **internal** copy (works on any npm ≥ 7)

If you’d rather avoid environment variables, overwrite the bundled copy that lives under `@npmcli/run-script`  ([node-gyp/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp.md at main · nodejs/node-gyp · GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp.md)):

```yaml
- name: Bump npm-internal node-gyp to 11.2.0 (Windows)
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  shell: cmd
  run: |
    for /f "delims=" %%P in ('where node') do set NODEDIR=%%~dpP
    cd "%NODEDIR%node_modules\npm\node_modules\@npmcli\run-script"
    npm install node-gyp@11.2.0 --no-save
```

Because you’re literally replacing the file that npm/pnpm shells out to, no further configuration is necessary.

---

## Other routes (choose only if they fit your project)

| Option | How | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| **Local dep override** | Declare `"node-gyp": "11.2.0"` in *devDependencies* – npm will prefer the *project* copy over its bundled one  ([How upgrade node-gyp with npm 10? · Issue #2942 - GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/2942?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Zero CI tweaks; works on every OS | Adds dev-only packages to your workspace |
| **Pre-built `node-pty` fork** | Use `npm:@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch`  ([Build Failure on Windows with Node.js 22.x -- node-pty Compilation ...](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/15029?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Skips compilation entirely | Larger download; ties you to that fork |
| **Downgrade Node** | Node 18 ships with npm 9, where `node_gyp` config still works | Easiest if you don’t need 20/22 features | You said downgrading isn’t an option |

---

## Quick checklist

1. **Did the env-var end up in the job?**  
   `echo $Env:NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP` or `npm config ls -l | findstr node_gyp`.
2. **Does the path actually exist?** It should be something like  
   `C:\npm\prefix\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js` – note *no* `\lib\` on Windows.
3. **Clean the override when pnpm upgrades.** Remove the step or delete the env var; the fix won’t be needed once pnpm bundles ≥ 11.2.0.

Apply one of the two fixes above, re-run the Windows job, and the green checkmarks should finally appear. Ping me if any of the steps still misbehave!

_**Assistant**_

Ah, thank you for the clarification and the updated information! It makes sense that `npm config set node_gyp` doesn't work anymore with npm 10 and that the environment variable `NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP` is the correct way forward.

I will now replace the previous step with the environment variable-based fix (Fix #1) you provided. This looks like a much cleaner solution for the CI environment.

---

```diff
  
        # pin-node-gyp-windows.yml  (snippet)
-       - name: Pin node-gyp 11.2.0 on Windows
+       - name: Pin node-gyp 11.2.0 on Windows (env-based)
          if: runner.os == 'Windows'
          shell: pwsh
          run: |
-           # 1) Install the good version globally
+           # 1) Install the fixed node-gyp globally
            npm install -g node-gyp@11.2.0
-           # 2) Point npm/pnpm at it (official PowerShell recipe)
-           npm prefix -g | % {
-             npm config set node_gyp "$_\\node_modules\\node-gyp\\bin\\node-gyp.js"
-           }
-           # 3) Verify
-           Write-Host "Using node-gyp at $(npm config get node_gyp)"
+           # 2) Export the path so every later npm/pnpm call uses it
+           $gyp = "$(npm prefix -g)\\node_modules\\node-gyp\\bin\\node-gyp.js"
+           echo "NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP=$gyp" | Out-File $env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
+           Write-Host "Will use node-gyp at $gyp"
  
        - name: pnpm install
```

---

Okay, I've updated the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file again. The step now correctly installs `node-gyp@11.2.0` globally and exports its path to the `NPM_CONFIG_NODE_GYP` environment variable using the PowerShell script you provided. This should ensure that subsequent `pnpm` calls use the correct version on Windows runners.
