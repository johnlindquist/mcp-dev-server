# VS Code Biome Configuration Troubleshooting (2025-04-29 11:44:54)

_**User**_

Understanding Formatting Discrepancies Between Biome CLI and VS Code ExtensionI. IntroductionDevelopers utilizing Biome within Visual Studio Code (VS Code) sometimes encounter perplexing inconsistencies where formatting results differ between running Biome commands directly from the command-line interface (CLI) and using the integrated formatting features provided by the Biome VS Code extension, particularly concerning package.json files. Even when the default formatter is set to Biome and a biome.json configuration file exists at the project root, discrepancies can arise. This report investigates the potential causes behind these differences, examining configuration loading mechanisms, binary resolution strategies, VS Code settings interactions, specific Biome configuration options, and known issues, culminating in a practical troubleshooting guide and recommendations for achieving consistent formatting behavior.II. Biome Configuration Loading: CLI vs. VS Code ExtensionThe way Biome locates and loads its configuration file (biome.json or biome.jsonc) is fundamental to its operation, and subtle differences exist between the CLI and the VS Code extension.Biome CLI: The CLI employs an auto-discovery mechanism. It starts searching for biome.json or biome.jsonc in the current working directory and traverses upwards through parent directories until a configuration file is found. If no file is located during this upward traversal, Biome applies its default settings.1 This allows for flexible project structures where configuration might reside in a parent directory common to multiple sub-projects. The CLI also supports explicitly specifying a configuration file path using the --config-path option or the BIOME_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.1Biome VS Code Extension: The VS Code extension has a more constrained approach to configuration discovery. It specifically looks for the biome.json file located directly within the workspace's root directory.2 If the configuration file is placed in a subfolder, the extension might fail to detect it, leading it to use default settings or potentially fail to activate properly.3 This difference in discovery logic is a common source of inconsistency; the CLI might find a config file in a parent directory or a sub-directory (if run from there), while the extension strictly expects it at the root of the opened VS Code workspace. While the extension setting biome.requireConfiguration can be set to false, allowing the extension to run without a biome.json, this typically means it operates with default formatting rules, which may differ from intended project standards.3 Some users have reported the extension randomly failing to find the root configuration file even when present, suggesting potential intermittent issues in the extension's file monitoring or loading logic.3III. Biome Binary Resolution in the VS Code ExtensionAnother critical factor influencing formatting behavior is the specific Biome binary executable being used. The CLI uses the biome command available in the system's PATH or executed via npx (which resolves to the project's local node_modules or a cached version). The VS Code extension, however, employs a prioritized strategy to determine which Biome binary to use for its operations (formatting, linting, language server features).2The resolution order is as follows:
Project's Local Dependencies (node_modules/@biomejs/biome): The extension first attempts to locate and use the Biome binary installed as a direct dependency within the project's node_modules directory.2 This is the recommended approach as it ensures that the version used by the extension aligns perfectly with the version used in CLI commands (e.g., in npm scripts or CI checks), promoting consistency.2 Pinning the exact version using --save-exact during installation is further advised to prevent unexpected behavior changes due to minor version updates.5
Explicitly Configured Path (biome.lspBin Setting): If a local dependency is not found, or if a user needs to override the default behavior (e.g., using a globally installed Biome or one located in a non-standard path), they can specify an explicit path to the Biome executable in the VS Code settings using the biome.lspBin option.2 This setting takes precedence over the local dependency check. If a relative path is provided, it's resolved relative to the workspace root folder.2 This is essential in scenarios where Biome is not installed at the project root, such as in monorepos with complex structures or when using Biome for non-Node.js projects.3
Bundled Biome Version: If Biome is neither found in the local node_modules nor explicitly configured via biome.lspBin, the extension falls back to using a version of the Biome binary that is bundled within the extension itself.2 While earlier versions of the extension included a bundled binary, newer versions may prompt the user to download a specific version if one isn't found locally or configured.7 This bundled or downloaded version ensures basic functionality but might differ from the project's intended Biome version, leading to formatting discrepancies. Some discussions indicate this downloaded binary might be stored in VS Code's user workspace storage directories.8
A mismatch between the Biome version used by the CLI (often the latest installed locally via npx or a globally installed one) and the version resolved by the VS Code extension (potentially an older local dependency, a bundled version, or one specified by lspBin) is a highly probable cause for differing formatting outputs.IV. VS Code Formatter Settings: Conflicts and PrecedenceVS Code's own settings system for formatters adds another layer of complexity. How these settings are configured across user, workspace, and language-specific levels can directly impact whether the Biome extension is invoked correctly, especially for JSON files.
editor.defaultFormatter: This setting determines the default formatter used for all languages unless overridden. Setting this to "biomejs.biome" globally (User Settings) or per-project (Workspace Settings) is the first step.2
editor.formatOnSave: This boolean setting enables automatic formatting when a file is saved. It relies on a default formatter being correctly configured.2
Language-Specific Settings: VS Code allows overriding the default formatter for specific languages using bracket notation, e.g., "[javascript]": { "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome" }. This is crucial. Even if Biome is set as the global default, a leftover language-specific setting like "[json]": { "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode" } would cause VS Code to use Prettier (or another specified formatter) for JSON files, ignoring the global Biome setting.2 Users migrating from Prettier often encounter issues if they don't update or remove these specific overrides.11 Formatting might fail or produce unexpected results if the [json] or [jsonc] sections still point to a different formatter or lack the correct Biome identifier ("biomejs.biome"). Some reports suggest that formatOnSave might only work reliably when these language-specific settings are explicitly configured for Biome, even if it's already the global default.11
User vs. Workspace Settings: VS Code settings can exist at the User level (applying globally) and the Workspace level (.vscode/settings.json, applying only to the current project). Workspace settings generally override User settings.6 Configuring formatter settings within the Workspace (.vscode/settings.json) is recommended for project consistency, ensuring all collaborators use the same formatter configuration regardless of their global User settings.13 However, if .vscode/settings.json is gitignored, these settings won't be shared.11
Other Extensions: Conflicts can arise if other formatting extensions (like Prettier, EditorConfig, language-specific formatters) are enabled and try to format the same files.14 VS Code might prompt the user to choose a formatter if multiple are available for a given language.15 Sometimes, settings from these other extensions might interfere even if Biome is set as the default.12
Incorrect or conflicting VS Code settings, particularly leftover language-specific configurations for JSON pointing to other formatters, are a frequent cause of the Biome extension not being used for package.json formatting, leading to discrepancies with the CLI.V. JSON Formatting Configuration in Biome (biome.json)Biome offers specific configuration options within biome.json to control how JSON files are formatted. These settings, if used, must be interpreted consistently by both the CLI and the extension.Relevant options under the json.formatter key include 16:
enabled: (boolean, default: true) Enables/disables JSON formatting.
indentStyle: ("tab" or "space", default: "tab") Sets the indentation character. Note that the default is tab, which might differ from common JavaScript/TypeScript project conventions often favoring spaces.17
indentWidth: (number, default: 2) Specifies the width of indentation.
lineWidth: (number, default: 80) Defines the maximum line length.
trailingCommas: ("none" or "all", default: "none") Controls trailing commas in multi-line JSON structures.
Additionally, Biome supports an overrides section in biome.json. This powerful feature allows defining different configurations for specific files or file patterns using glob syntax.1 This can be used to apply unique formatting rules specifically to package.json:JSON{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2
  },
  "json": {
    "formatter": {
      "indentStyle": "tab" // Default for other JSON files
    }
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "include": ["package.json"], // Target only package.json
      "formatter": {
        // Inherits top-level formatter settings if not specified
        "indentStyle": "space", // Ensure package.json uses spaces
        "indentWidth": 2
      },
      "json": {
        // Specific JSON parser/formatter settings for package.json
        "parser": {
           "allowComments": true // Example: Allow comments if needed
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
If the biome.json contains specific json.formatter settings or overrides targeting package.json, any inconsistency in how the CLI versus the VS Code extension reads or applies these specific rules could lead to different formatting outcomes. For instance, if the extension fails to load the root config (as discussed in Section II), it wouldn't apply these JSON-specific rules at all, defaulting to potentially different formatting behavior compared to the CLI which does read the configuration.VI. Analysis of Discrepancies: Known Issues and PatternsReviewing official documentation, community discussions, and GitHub issue trackers reveals several recurring themes and known issues that can cause formatting inconsistencies between the Biome CLI and its VS Code extension.
Configuration File Location: As established, the VS Code extension strictly expects biome.json at the workspace root, unlike the CLI's more flexible discovery.2 Issues like #1416 directly report the VS Code extension ignoring the root config and applying defaults, while the CLI worked correctly.12 Moving the config to the root is often the primary solution suggested.3
Binary Version Mismatch: The different resolution strategies (Section III) frequently lead to the CLI and extension using different Biome versions. Since formatting rules can evolve between versions, this is a prime suspect for discrepancies.2 Checking the versions used by both is a key diagnostic step.2 The extension's output panel might log the version it's using or indicate issues finding the binary.18
VS Code Settings Conflicts: Leftover Prettier settings, especially language-specific [json] overrides, are a common culprit preventing Biome from formatting JSON files in VS Code.11 General VS Code formatter configuration issues can also prevent format-on-save even if manual formatting works.15
Rule Application/Interpretation Bugs: While less common, there have been reported instances where the extension and CLI applied formatting rules differently even with the same version and configuration. Issue #1100 described disagreements on formatting long strings and empty braces.18 Issue #373 involved the extension failing to format certain file types due to glob pattern interpretation bugs related to path separators.23 Issue #2767, although about linting, showed VS Code reporting an error the CLI did not, indicating potential analysis differences between the LSP/extension and the CLI.24 These suggest that the integration layer (LSP, extension wrapper) can sometimes introduce subtle behavioral differences compared to direct CLI execution.
Caching Issues: Some users have resolved persistent or intermittent extension failures by clearing Biome-related caches (e.g., in ~/Library/Caches/dev.biomejs.biome/ on macOS or similar platform-specific locations) and reinstalling the extension.3 This suggests that corrupted cache data can sometimes interfere with the extension's operation.
Formatting Diagnostics Philosophy: It's important to understand that Biome, by design, generally does not report formatting deviations as errors or warnings (diagnostics) within the editor like some ESLint+Prettier setups might.25 The expectation is that formatting is applied automatically (e.g., on save) rather than flagged as an issue to be manually fixed. This difference in philosophy means a lack of "squiggly lines" for formatting issues in VS Code is expected Biome behavior, not necessarily a sign of malfunction.25
Synthesizing these points reveals that discrepancies often stem from the complex interaction between Biome's core logic, the Language Server Protocol (LSP), the VS Code extension wrapper, VS Code's settings system, and the project's specific environment (dependencies, file structure). Problems frequently arise at these integration points rather than solely within Biome's core formatting engine.VII. Troubleshooting Checklist & RecommendationsTo diagnose and resolve formatting inconsistencies between the Biome CLI and the VS Code extension for package.json files, follow this checklist systematically:
Verify biome.json Location: Confirm that your biome.json or biome.jsonc file is located precisely at the root of the folder opened in VS Code (the workspace root). If it's in a subdirectory, move it to the root.2
Check VS Code Formatter Settings:

Open both User Settings (JSON) and Workspace Settings (JSON) (.vscode/settings.json).
Search for "editor.defaultFormatter". Ensure it is set to "biomejs.biome" at the most appropriate level (Workspace is preferred for project consistency).
Search for language-specific blocks: "[json]" and "[jsonc]". Inside these blocks, ensure "editor.defaultFormatter" is explicitly set to "biomejs.biome". Critically, remove or comment out any lines within these blocks that set the default formatter to anything else (e.g., "esbenp.prettier-vscode").2
Ensure "editor.formatOnSave" is set to true if you desire automatic formatting on save.2


Check Biome Versions:

In your project's integrated terminal, run the command you use for CLI formatting (e.g., npx biome --version or pnpm biome --version). Record the reported CLI version.
In VS Code, open the Output panel (View -> Output) and select "Biome" from the dropdown menu. Examine the logs. Look for lines indicating the version of the Biome LSP server being used or the path to the binary it resolved. Compare this to the CLI version.2
If versions differ significantly, proceed to Recommendation #1 below.


Inspect biome.json for JSON Formatting Rules:

Review your biome.json for settings under json.formatter (e.g., indentStyle, indentWidth). Ensure these reflect your desired package.json format (e.g., "indentStyle": "space", "indentWidth": 2).
Check for any overrides sections that might include or exclude package.json or apply conflicting rules.16 Consider explicitly adding an override for package.json if specific formatting is needed that differs from other JSON files.


Check Biome VS Code Extension Output Panel: Carefully read the logs in the "Biome" output channel for any errors or warnings. Messages like "Could not resolve Biome", "Configuration file required", "Extension bundle does not include the prebuilt binary", or LSP connection errors can pinpoint the problem.18
Test Basic Formatting: Save or manually format (Ctrl+Shift+P -> Format Document) a standard JavaScript or TypeScript file in the project. If this also fails, it indicates a general problem with the Biome extension setup (binary resolution, core activation). If only JSON/package.json formatting is inconsistent, the issue is more likely related to configuration loading or language-specific settings.19
Explicitly Specify Binary (If Necessary): If the Output logs suggest the extension cannot find the Biome binary, or if you strongly suspect a version mismatch is the cause and cannot easily align them via dependencies, try setting the biome.lspBin path in your Workspace .vscode/settings.json. Point it directly to the known-correct Biome executable (e.g., "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/bin/biome" if installed locally, or the path to a global install).2
Reload VS Code Window: After making any changes to biome.json, VS Code settings, or project dependencies (node_modules), use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to run "Developer: Reload Window". This ensures VS Code and the extension pick up the latest changes.27 A full restart of VS Code might also be beneficial.14
Clear Cache / Reinstall Extension: If problems persist inexplicably, try clearing Biome's cache files (location varies by OS, e.g., ~/Library/Caches/dev.biomejs.biome/ on macOS, check Biome docs or issue #53 for potential locations) and/or uninstalling and then reinstalling the Biome VS Code extension.3 Remember to reload the window after reinstalling.
Disable Conflicting Extensions: Temporarily disable other extensions that might interfere with formatting, such as Prettier, EditorConfig, or other linters/formatters, to isolate whether the issue is caused by a conflict.14
Recommendations for Achieving Consistency:
Prioritize Local Project Dependency: The most robust way to ensure version alignment is to install @biomejs/biome as a pinned development dependency in your project (npm install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome or equivalent for yarn/pnpm/bun).2 Configure your CLI scripts (in package.json) to use this local version (e.g., npx biome check.) and allow the VS Code extension to automatically resolve it from node_modules.
Use Explicit Workspace Settings: Define your default formatter and necessary language-specific overrides ([json], [jsonc]) within the project's .vscode/settings.json file.2 This ensures the correct formatter is used for the project, regardless of individual developers' global settings, and makes the configuration explicit and shareable (if the file is checked into version control).
Maintain biome.json at Workspace Root: Adhere to the VS Code extension's expectation by keeping the biome.json (or biome.jsonc) file directly in the root directory of your VS Code workspace.2
Pin Biome Version: Use the --save-exact flag (or equivalent for your package manager) when adding the @biomejs/biome dependency to prevent automatic minor/patch updates that could introduce subtle formatting changes.5
VIII. ConclusionDiscrepancies in package.json formatting between the Biome CLI and its VS Code extension typically arise not from fundamental differences in the core formatting engine, but from inconsistencies in the surrounding environment and configuration layers. The most probable causes include:
A mismatch between the Biome binary version used by the CLI and the version resolved by the VS Code extension.
Conflicts or incorrect configurations within VS Code's formatter settings, particularly leftover language-specific settings for JSON pointing to other tools like Prettier, or improper setup of editor.defaultFormatter.
The VS Code extension failing to locate or load the biome.json configuration file due to it not being present at the workspace root.
By systematically working through the troubleshooting checklist provided—verifying configuration file location, meticulously inspecting VS Code settings (user, workspace, and language-specific for JSON), confirming Biome version alignment (ideally by using a local project dependency), checking extension logs, and ensuring no conflicts exist—users can effectively diagnose and resolve these inconsistencies. Adhering to the recommendations, particularly using a pinned local dependency and explicit workspace settings, offers the most reliable path to achieving consistent and predictable formatting behavior across both the Biome CLI and the VS Code integrated experience.

Can you help me investigate my VS Code settings for my workspace project to make sure things are correct for biome?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I can help you investigate your VS Code workspace settings.

First, I need to see if a `.vscode/settings.json` file exists in your workspace and read its contents.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory .vscode • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `settings.json` |

</details>

---

Great, the `.vscode/settings.json` file exists. Now I'll read its content to check the configuration.

---

Read file: .vscode/settings.json

---

Okay, I've reviewed your `.vscode/settings.json`. Here's the analysis:

1.  **`editor.defaultFormatter`**: You have `"editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"`. This correctly sets Biome as the default formatter for the workspace.
2.  **`biome.requireConfigFile`**: You have `"biome.requireConfigFile": true`. This ensures the Biome extension requires a `biome.json` file to be present, which is generally good practice.
3.  **Missing Language-Specific Settings**: The most common cause of inconsistency, especially for `package.json`, is missing or conflicting language-specific settings. Your current settings file does **not** explicitly configure Biome as the formatter for JSON or JSONC files (`[json]` or `[jsonc]`). While setting the global default *should* work, VS Code's settings precedence can be tricky, and leftover user settings or other extensions might interfere. Explicitly setting it for JSON/JSONC is safer.
4.  **Missing `formatOnSave`**: You don't have `"editor.formatOnSave": true` specified in your workspace settings. If you want files to be automatically formatted by Biome when you save them, you'll need to add this.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure Biome is consistently used for formatting, especially for JSON files like `package.json`, and to enable format on save, I recommend adding the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome",
  "biome.requireConfigFile": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true, // Enable format on save
  "[json]": { // Explicitly set for JSON files
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
  },
  "[jsonc]": { // Explicitly set for JSON with Comments files
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
  }
}
```

Would you like me to apply these changes to your `.vscode/settings.json` file?

---

_**User**_

Yes, please.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I will update your `.vscode/settings.json` file now.

---

```diff
  {
  	"editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome",
- 	"biome.requireConfigFile": true
+ 	"biome.requireConfigFile": true,
+ 	"editor.formatOnSave": true,
+ 	"[json]": {
+ 		"editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
+ 	},
+ 	"[jsonc]": {
+ 		"editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
+ 	}
  }
  
```

---

I have updated the `.vscode/settings.json` file with the recommended settings, including enabling format on save and explicitly setting Biome as the formatter for JSON and JSONC files.

This should help ensure consistent formatting behavior for your `package.json` and other JSON files between the CLI and the VS Code extension.

_**User**_

Based on the task you just performed, what would be a very terse way to restate the original goal so that you end up on everything you just did? I think what you just did was perfect and I would like to be able to state it again in the future in a very terse and concise way.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, here are a few terse ways to restate the goal that should lead to the same sequence of actions:

**Option 1 (Focus on Action & Workflow):**

> Configure Biome for JSON in VSCode workspace settings, then commit the changes and create/auto-merge a PR.

*   *Why it works:* Clearly states the configuration goal (`Configure Biome for JSON in VSCode workspace settings`), the action (`commit the changes`), and the desired Git/GitHub workflow (`create/auto-merge a PR`).

**Option 2 (Slightly more specific):**

> Update `.vscode/settings.json` to ensure Biome formats JSON, then handle the Git/PR process (branch, commit, push, create PR, auto-merge).

*   *Why it works:* Explicitly mentions the file (`.vscode/settings.json`), the objective (`ensure Biome formats JSON`), and spells out the expected Git/PR steps.

**Option 3 (Most Concise):**

> Fix Biome JSON formatting in VSCode settings and auto-merge the fix via GitHub PR.

*   *Why it works:* Focuses on the *problem* (`Fix Biome JSON formatting`), the *location* (`VSCode settings`), and the end result (`auto-merge... via GitHub PR`), relying on the AI to infer the necessary Git steps.

Choose the one that feels most natural to you. Option 1 is probably a good balance of clarity and conciseness for reliably reproducing the steps.

---

_**User**_

Oh sorry, I was talking specifically about the git actions.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Ah, I understand. You just want a terse way to request the Git and GitHub workflow actions. Here are a few options for just that part:

**Option 1 (Focus on the end result):**

> Commit changes and auto-merge via GitHub PR.

*   *Why it works:* This implies the necessary preceding steps (branching, staging, pushing, PR creation) to achieve the auto-merge.

**Option 2 (Slightly more explicit):**

> Create a branch, commit changes, push, create a PR, and auto-merge it.

*   *Why it works:* Directly lists the main Git/GitHub actions in sequence.

**Option 3 (Using 'handle'):**

> Handle the Git/GitHub workflow for the current changes: branch, commit, push, create PR, auto-merge.

*   *Why it works:* Uses 'handle' as shorthand and lists the key steps.

**Option 4 (Most Concise):**

> Auto-merge commit via GH PR workflow.

*   *Why it works:* Very brief, relies on understanding that "GH PR workflow" includes branching, pushing, and creating the PR before the auto-merge.

Option 1 or Option 2 are likely the clearest and most reliable ways to request that specific Git/GitHub sequence.

---

_**User**_

Give me a more verbose way where it's still terse but unmistakable as to what I'm asking someone to do.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, here's a more verbose yet still relatively terse instruction that should be unmistakable:

> **"Create a feature branch, commit the current changes, push the branch, create a GitHub PR, and set it to auto-merge (squash and delete branch)."**

*   **"Create a feature branch"**: Explicitly asks for a new branch (implies checking it out).
*   **"commit the current changes"**: Specifies committing the staged/tracked changes.
*   **"push the branch"**: Clearly asks to push the new branch to the remote.
*   **"create a GitHub PR"**: Explicitly asks for the pull request creation.
*   **"set it to auto-merge (squash and delete branch)"**: Details the desired merge strategy and cleanup action, removing ambiguity about *how* it should be merged.
