# Project Packing Instructions (2025-05-06 15:23:46)

_**User**_

Please pack up this project.

Okay, I can help with that. I see a `repomix` rule that seems relevant to "packing up" a project. I'll fetch it to get the specific instructions.


---

  -h, --help                         display help for command```

---

Okay, I've fetched the `repomix` rule. It looks like `repomix` is a command-line tool that packs a repository into a single file.

To pack up this project, I'll run the `repomix` command. I'll use the default settings, which should pack the current directory (`.`) into an output file. Since no output file is specified by default, I'll add `-o repomix_output.md` to create a Markdown file with the packed project.


---

```bash
repomix -o repomix_output.md
```

```

The `repomix` command completed successfully and created the file `repomix_output.md` in the root of your project. This file contains the packed version of your project.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

---

_**User**_

That's way too many tokens. Can you look at the Repomix API and find a way of... I think we need to ignore that spec story directory and save that into a config so it's never read from again.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I can help with that. The `repomix` tool has an `--ignore` option to exclude specific patterns and an `--init` option to create a configuration file. We can use these to ignore the `.specstory` directory and save this setting.

First, I'll initialize a `repomix.config.json` file in your project's root directory. The terminal's current working directory is `/Users/johnlindquist/.kenv`, so I'll need to `cd` into the project directory first, which is `/Users/johnlindquist/dev/mcp-dev-server`.


---

```bash
cd /Users/johnlindquist/dev/mcp-dev-server && repomix --init
```

```

It seems `repomix --init` is interactive. According to your instructions, I should always use non-interactive commands.

Let's try a different approach. The help output mentions:
`-c, --config <path>`: path to a custom config file.
`--ignore <patterns>`: additional ignore patterns (comma-separated).

If a `repomix.config.json` file exists, `repomix` should use it. I will create a `repomix.config.json` file with the ignore pattern for `.specstory` and then run `repomix`.

First, I'll create the `repomix.config.json` file.


---

```diff
      "useGitignore": true,
      "useDefaultPatterns": true,
-     "customPatterns": []
+     "customPatterns": [
+       ".specstory"
+     ]
    },
    "security": {
```

---

It seems the `edit_file` tool tried to modify an existing `repomix.config.json` instead of creating a new one based on my `code_edit` content. This happened because the `repomix --init` command in the previous step actually *did* create a default `repomix.config.json` file, even though it was interactive. My apologies, I missed that in the output.

The default config structure is a bit different from what I was trying to write. Let's try to edit the existing file correctly this time. I need to read the file first to understand its structure.


---

Read file: repomix.config.json

---

Okay, I see the structure now. The previous edit attempt was actually very close! It looks like the `edit_file` tool correctly identified where to put `.specstory`, but I had specified `output` in the wrong place.

The current `repomix.config.json` has:
```json
{
  // ...
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml", // We want repomix_output.md
    "style": "xml", // We want markdown
    // ...
  },
  // ...
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    "customPatterns": [".specstory"] // This is correctly added by the previous edit attempt.
  },
  // ...
}
```
I will now edit `repomix.config.json` to change `output.filePath` to `repomix_output.md` and `output.style` to `markdown`. The `.specstory` directory should already be in the `ignore.customPatterns` array from the previous partially successful edit.


---

```diff
  	},
  	"output": {
- 		"filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
- 		"style": "xml",
+ 		"filePath": "repomix_output.md",
+ 		"style": "markdown",
  		"parsableStyle": false,
  		"fileSummary": true,
```

---

Great, the `repomix.config.json` file should now be correctly configured to ignore the `.specstory` directory and output to `repomix_output.md` in Markdown format.

Now, I'll run `repomix` again. It should automatically use the `repomix.config.json` file.

Excellent! `repomix` has run successfully using the updated configuration.

As you can see from the output:
- The `.specstory` directory was ignored.
- The total token count is now **139,450 tokens**, significantly down from over 20 million.
- The output is in `repomix_output.md`.

The `repomix.config.json` file now permanently stores your preference to ignore the `.specstory` directory and output to `repomix_output.md` in markdown format.
