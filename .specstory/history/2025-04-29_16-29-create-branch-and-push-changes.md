# Create Branch and Push Changes (2025-04-29 10:29:26)

_**User**_

@post-checkout @ci.yml Create a branch based on these two files and commit and push them.

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I can help with that. I'll create a branch named `chore/update-ci-and-hooks`, stage the changes in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.husky/post-checkout`, commit them, and push the branch.

First, I'll create the new branch.

---

```bash
git checkout -b chore/update-ci-and-hooks
```

```
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main) ✗ git checkout -b chore/update-ci-and-hooks
Switched to a new branch 'chore/update-ci-and-hooks'
husky - DEPRECATED

Please remove the following two lines from .husky/post-checkout:

#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

They WILL FAIL in v10.0.0

➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main) ✗
```

---

Now, I'll stage the two files.

---

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml .husky/post-checkout
```

```
?➜  mcp-dev-server git:(chore/update-ci-and-hooks) ?✗ 

```

---

Next, I'll commit the staged changes.

---

```bash
git commit -m 'Update CI workflow and post-checkout hook'
```

```
<ommit -m 'Update CI workflow and post-checkout hook' 
→ No staged files match any configured task.

 2 files changed, 69 insertions(+), 52 deletions(-)
 create mode 100755 .husky/post-checkout
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(chore/update-ci-and-hooks) ✗
```

---

Finally, I'll push the new branch to the remote repository.

---

```bash
git push -u origin chore/update-ci-and-hooks
```

```
