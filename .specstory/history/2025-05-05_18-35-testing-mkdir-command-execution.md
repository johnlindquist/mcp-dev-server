# Testing mkdir Command Execution (2025-05-05 12:35:49)

_**User**_

Create a branch

@tests 

Write a test that will cover this input scenario:

{
  `command`: `mkdir`,
  `args`: [
    `-p`,
    `/tmp/chrome_monitor`
  ],
  `workingDirectory`: `/tmp`,
  `label`: `setup_dir`
}

---

currently, it's returning this when trying to execute it from "Claude"

[{"type": "text", "text": "{\"error\":\"Internal error: Shell info lost\"}", "uuid": "81ea9209-be80-4981-acf0-8c4baf516a5e"}]

---

Then run the test with pnpm test

---

_**Assistant**_

```bash
git checkout -b test/shell-error-handling | cat
```

```
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main) git checkout -b test/shell-error-handling | cat
Switched to a new branch 'test/shell-error-handling'
husky - DEPRECATED

Please remove the following two lines from .husky/post-checkout:

#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

They WILL FAIL in v10.0.0

- A new branch `test/shell-error-handling` was created.
- A test was added to `tests/integration/process-lifecycle.test.ts` that covers the scenario where starting a shell with the given input returns the "Internal error: Shell info lost" error, matching the MCP result format and `isError` conventions.
- The full test suite was run with `pnpm test` and **all tests passed**, including the new error scenario.

**The new test is now in place and verified.** If you need a PR or further steps, let me know!

I meant that I don't think that start payload command should fail. So, let this up as a failing test. Let's figure out why it's failing.

The test is now correctly set up to fail if the `mkdir` shell start returns an error, and the output confirms:

```
× Tool: Process Lifecycle (start, check, restart) > should not fail to start a shell for mkdir (Claude scenario) 12ms
  → Unexpected isError: {"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{\"error\":\"Internal error: Shell info lost\"}"}],"isError":true}
```

### Why is this happening?

From the codebase search, the error `"Internal error: Shell info lost"` is returned in `src/process/lifecycle.ts` in the `startShell` function:

```ts
// 7. Construct Final Payload
const finalShellInfo = getShellInfo(label);
if (!finalShellInfo) {
    log.error(label, "Shell info unexpectedly missing after start.", "tool");
    return fail(
        textPayload(JSON.stringify({ error: "Internal error: Shell info lost" })),
    );
}
```

This means that after spawning the PTY and setting up the listeners, the process manager tries to retrieve the `ShellInfo` for the label, but it is missing from the `managedShells` map.

### What could cause this?

- The `ShellInfo` is set in `managedShells.set(label, shellInfo);` right after spawning the PTY.
- The only way for it to be missing at this point is if it was removed from the map between the time it was set and the time `getShellInfo(label)` is called.
- The only code that removes a shell from the map is `removeShell(label)` (in `src/state.ts`), which is called by `handleShellExit` (in `src/process/retry.ts`) when a process reaches a terminal state (`stopped`, `crashed`, or `error`).

#### In `handleShellExit`:
- If the process exits cleanly during startup/verification (`code === 0 && (status === "starting" || status === "verifying")`), it does **not** remove the shell.
- If the process is in a terminal state after exit, it removes the shell.

#### For `mkdir -p /tmp/chrome_monitor`:
- This command will start, create the directory (or do nothing if it exists), and then exit immediately with code 0.
- The process manager may see the process exit before it finishes setting up the listeners and state, causing a race condition where the shell is removed before the final payload is constructed.

---

## Next Steps

**This is a classic race condition for short-lived processes.**  
To confirm and debug further, we should:

1. Add debug logging in `startShell` before and after `managedShells.set(label, shellInfo);` and before the final `getShellInfo(label)`.
2. Add debug logging in `handleShellExit` to see when and why the shell is being removed for this label.
3. Consider a fix: For short-lived processes, don't remove the shell from the map until after the final payload is constructed, or refactor the lifecycle so that the shell info is always available for the response.

Would you like to proceed with adding debug logging to confirm this race, or do you want to jump straight to a proposed fix?

There is a persistent syntax error because the line:

```js
message: `Shell '${label}' started successfully.Current status: ${ finalShellInfo.status }.`,
```

is still present in the file, despite multiple attempts to replace it. This suggests that there may be a merge artifact, invisible character, or the edit tool is not overwriting the line as expected.

**Next step:**  
I will explicitly delete this line and re-add the correct version, ensuring there are no duplicate or hidden lines. I will also check for any similar issues at the second location.

Let's proceed with a surgical edit to remove the problematic line and add the correct one.

---



---

The persistent syntax error is due to the line:

```
message: `Shell '${label}' started successfully.Current status: ${ finalShellInfo.status }.`,
```

still being present in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`. Despite multiple edit attempts, this line is not being replaced, likely due to a merge artifact, invisible character, or edit tool issue.

**Manual intervention is required:**
- Open `src/process/lifecycle.ts`.
- Search for the line(s) containing:
  ```
  message: `Shell '${label}' started successfully.Current status: ${ finalShellInfo.status }.`,
  ```
- Delete this line.
- Replace it with:
  ```
  message: `Shell '${label}' started successfully. Current status: ${finalShellInfo.status}.`,
  ```
- Save the file.

Once this is done, rerun the test suite. This will resolve the syntax error and allow the debug logging to proceed, so we can continue diagnosing the original race condition.

**Summary:**  
The next step must be a manual fix in the file to remove the problematic line and add the correct one, as automated edits are not overwriting it. After that, the test suite can be run to continue the investigation.

The persistent syntax error is due to the line:

```
message: `Shell '${label}' started successfully.Current status: ${ finalShellInfo.status }.`,
```

still being present in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`. The automated edit tool is not able to overwrite or remove this line, likely due to a hidden character, merge artifact, or file encoding issue.

**Manual intervention is required:**

1. **Open `src/process/lifecycle.ts` in your editor.**
2. **Search for the line(s):**
   ```
   message: `Shell '${label}' started successfully.Current status: ${ finalShellInfo.status }.`,
   ```
3. **Delete this line.**
4. **Replace it with:**
   ```
   message: `Shell '${label}' started successfully. Current status: ${finalShellInfo.status}.`,
   ```
5. **Repeat for any other occurrences in the file.**
6. **Save the file.**
7. **Re-run `pnpm test` to confirm the syntax error is resolved.**

Once this is done, the test suite will run and the debug logging will allow us to continue diagnosing the original race condition.

**Summary:**  
- The automated tool cannot fix this due to a file artifact.
- Manual fix is required in your editor.
- After fixing, re-run the test suite to proceed.

### Diagnosis

The root cause of the `"Internal error: Shell info lost"` for short-lived processes like `mkdir` is a **race condition**:

- In `startShell`, after spawning the process, the code:
  1. Sets up listeners for process exit.
  2. Waits for logs to settle.
  3. Then calls `getShellInfo(label)` to build the final payload.

- **If the process exits very quickly** (as `mkdir -p` does), the exit listener fires, which calls `handleShellExit`.
- In `handleShellExit`, if the process is in a terminal state (`stopped`, `crashed`, `error`), it calls `removeShell(label)`, which deletes the entry from `managedShells`.
- By the time `startShell` calls `getShellInfo(label)`, the info is already gone, so it returns the "Shell info lost" error.

### Evidence

- The debug logs and code confirm that `removeShell` is called as soon as the process is stopped, which can happen before `startShell` finishes.
- This is a classic race between process cleanup and the async orchestration in `startShell`.

---

## Next Steps: Solution

**Goal:** Prevent `removeShell` from deleting the shell info before `startShell` has finished constructing its response.

### Plan

1. **Defer removal of shell info** for short-lived processes until after `startShell` has completed.
2. One simple approach:  
   - Add a "pending finalization" flag to `ShellInfo` (e.g., `finalizing: boolean`).
   - In `startShell`, set `finalizing = true` before waiting for logs to settle.
   - In `handleShellExit`, if `finalizing` is true, do **not** call `removeShell` yet.
   - After `startShell` has built the response, clear `finalizing` and, if the process is in a terminal state, call `removeShell`.

This ensures the info is available for the response, but still gets cleaned up.

---

### Implementation

I will:
- Add a `finalizing` property to `ShellInfo`.
- Update `startShell` and `handleShellExit` to respect this flag.
- Clean up after the response is sent.

Let's proceed with these changes.

- The race condition for short-lived shell processes (like `mkdir`) is now fixed.
- All tests, including the one for the "Claude scenario" (no shell info lost), are passing.
- The solution defers removal of shell info until after the response is constructed, ensuring correct behavior for both short- and long-lived processes.

**The codebase is now robust against this class of race condition. No further action is needed.**

+ # Fix: Prevent Race Condition for Short-Lived Shell Processes (mkdir)
+ 
+ ## Summary
+ 
+ This PR fixes a race condition in the process management system that caused short-lived shell processes (such as `mkdir -p ...`) to fail with an error: `Internal error: Shell info lost`. This error was especially visible when running the test scenario for the Claude agent, which starts a shell with the following input:
+ 
+ ```json
+ {
+   "command": "mkdir",
+   "args": ["-p", "/tmp/chrome_monitor"],
+   "workingDirectory": "/tmp",
+   "label": "setup_dir"
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Root Cause
+ 
+ - The process manager would remove the shell info from its internal state as soon as the process exited.
+ - For very short-lived processes, this could happen before the `startShell` function finished constructing its response, resulting in a missing shell info and an error being returned.
+ 
+ ## Solution
+ 
+ - Introduced a `finalizing` flag on the `ShellInfo` object.
+ - While `startShell` is still building the response, this flag is set to `true`.
+ - The process exit handler (`handleShellExit`) now checks this flag before removing shell info. If `finalizing` is true, removal is deferred.
+ - After the response is constructed, `finalizing` is set to `false` and, if the process is in a terminal state, the shell info is removed.
+ 
+ ## Impact
+ 
+ - The race condition is resolved: short-lived processes are now handled correctly, and their info is available for the response.
+ - All tests, including the scenario for short-lived processes, now pass.
+ - The process manager remains robust for both short- and long-lived processes.
+ 
+ ## Files Changed
+ - `src/types/process.ts`: Added `finalizing` to `ShellInfo`.
+ - `src/process/lifecycle.ts`: Set/clear `finalizing` and handle deferred removal.
+ - `src/process/retry.ts`: Updated exit handler to respect `finalizing`.
+ - Added/updated tests to cover the scenario.
