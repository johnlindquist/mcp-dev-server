# Automating Git Pull on Main Checkout (2025-04-29 10:23:28)

_**User**_

Is there some sort of git hook that whenever I check out to main that it can automatically pull changes?

Yes, you can use a `post-checkout` Git hook for that. This hook runs after you successfully check out a branch. You can add a script to it that checks if the newly checked-out branch is `main` and, if so, runs `git pull`.

Since you have a `.husky` directory, it looks like you're using Husky to manage Git hooks. Let's check if you already have a `post-checkout` hook.

I'll list the contents of the `.husky` directory.

---

            <summary>Listed directory .husky ‚Ä¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÅ `_` |
| üìÑ `pre-commit` |

</details>

---

Okay, it looks like you only have a `pre-commit` hook currently.

I will now create the `post-checkout` hook script inside the `.husky` directory with the logic to pull `main` automatically.

---

```diff
- 
+ #!/bin/sh
+ . "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
+ 
+ # Get previous HEAD, new HEAD, and branch checkout flag
+ previous_head="$1"
+ new_head="$2"
+ is_branch_checkout="$3"
+ 
+ # Only run on branch checkouts
+ if [ "$is_branch_checkout" = "1" ]; then
+   # Get the current branch name
+   current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
+ 
+   # Check if the current branch is main
+   if [ "$current_branch" = "main" ]; then
+     echo "Switched to main branch. Pulling latest changes..."
+     git pull origin main || exit 1 # Exit if pull fails to prevent inconsistent state
+   fi
+ fi
+ 
+ exit 0 
```

---

Now, I need to make the hook script executable.

---

```bash
chmod +x .husky/post-checkout
```

```
?‚ûú  mcp-dev-server git:(main) ?‚úó 

```

---

The `post-checkout` hook is now set up. The next time you run `git checkout main`, it should automatically run `git pull origin main`.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Matches a schema that is not allowed.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

The linter error "Matches a schema that is not allowed" in your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file likely occurs because specifying `branches: ['*']` is redundant or conflicting when you also use `branches-ignore: [ main ]`.

To run the workflow on pushes to all branches *except* `main`, you only need to specify `branches-ignore`. The workflow implicitly applies to all branches if `branches` is omitted.

I will remove the `branches` filter.

---

```diff
  on:
    push:
-     branches:
-       - '*'       # Run on pushes to all branches
      branches-ignore: [ main ]
  
```

---

This change should resolve the linter error by simplifying the push trigger configuration.
