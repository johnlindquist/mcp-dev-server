# Integration Tests for Short-Lived Shell Processes (2025-05-04 12:45:32)

_**User**_

@tests @startShell() 

We need to write some integration tests around start shell for short-lived processes that will only print into maybe a single line and then exit really quickly. The way that shell meant for long-running shells, I don't think we've properly accounted for really quick commands. I believe we are garbage collecting shell on exit, so we need to start making some integration tests around quick shells. Make sure that it still captures all of the logs, puts everything once the response of the start shell. Can you please write some integration tests around that, then run them with pnpm test. The tests fail. Please investigate and fix it. Please start by creating a new branch for this work.

Please remove the following two lines from .husky/post-checkout:

- Added a new integration test suite ("Quick Shell Process Capture") to `tests/integration/process-lifecycle.test.ts` that specifically tests `start_shell` for short-lived processes (node, bash, python echo scripts).
- Each test starts a process that prints a single line and exits quickly, then asserts that the output is captured in `shellLogs` in the start response.
- Ran the tests with `pnpm test tests/integration/process-lifecycle.test.ts`. All tests, including the new quick shell tests, passed.

**No failures or issues were found.**  
The codebase currently handles quick, short-lived shell processes correctly and captures their logs as expected.

Would you like to push this branch, open a PR, or proceed with further improvements?

_**User**_

Please add another integration test for start shell, where it starts a quick shell and runs check shell to make sure that when they run check shell, it doesn't support that there's any process available properly cleaned up.

The new integration test for quick shell cleanup was added and the test suite runs, but the linter flagged a `let startResult: any = null;` usage (introduced to work around type issues with `shellLogs`/`toolLogs` not being on `ProcessStatusResult`). This is the only linter error, and it blocks the test run due to your strict linting policy.

**Next step:**  
Refactor the test to avoid `any` and use a proper type assertion or type extension for the expected result shape, while still allowing the test to check for `shellLogs` and `toolLogs`.

I will fix this linter error now.

- Added a new integration test to the "Quick Shell Process Capture" suite that:
  - Starts a quick shell (node echo script).
  - Waits for it to exit.
  - Runs `check_shell` and asserts that the process is no longer available (either an error or a non-running status).

- Refactored the test code to use a type-safe helper interface (`ProcessStatusWithLogs`) instead of `any`, resolving all linter errors.

- Ran the full test suite. All tests passed, including the new quick shell cleanup test.  
- No linter or type errors remain.

**Result:**  
You now have robust integration coverage for quick shell process cleanup and log capture, with all tests and lint checks passing.

Would you like to proceed with a PR, further improvements, or something else?

+ # Integration Tests: Quick Shell Process Log Capture & Cleanup
+ 
+ ## Summary
+ 
+ This PR adds and improves integration tests for the process lifecycle, specifically targeting short-lived (quick) shell processes. The changes ensure robust log capture and proper cleanup for processes that start, print output, and exit rapidly.
+ 
+ ### Key Changes
+ 
+ - **New Integration Tests:**
+   - Added a `Quick Shell Process Capture` test suite to `tests/integration/process-lifecycle.test.ts`.
+   - Tests for node, bash, and python echo scripts that print a line and exit quickly.
+   - Asserts that all output is captured in `shellLogs` in the `start_shell` response.
+   - Added a test to start a quick shell, wait for it to exit, and then run `check_shell` to ensure the process is properly cleaned up (not found or not running).
+ 
+ - **Type Safety & Linting:**
+   - Introduced a helper interface (`ProcessStatusWithLogs`) to extend the expected result shape for log assertions, eliminating the need for `any` and resolving all linter/type errors.
+   - All tests and lint checks pass cleanly.
+ 
+ - **Coverage Improvements:**
+   - The process lifecycle integration tests now robustly cover both long-running and short-lived shell processes, including log capture and resource cleanup.
+ 
+ ## Motivation
+ 
+ - Ensures that the MCP process manager correctly handles and reports on short-lived processes, which are common in real-world automation and scripting scenarios.
+ - Guarantees that logs are not lost and that process state is cleaned up, preventing resource leaks or stale process records.
+ 
+ ## Verification
+ 
+ - All new and existing tests pass (`pnpm test`).
+ - No linter or type errors remain.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ This PR is ready for review and merge.

**Pull Request URL:**  
https://github.com/johnlindquist/mcp-pm/pull/45

**Summary of work:**
- Added a new integration test suite for quick shell process log capture and cleanup.
- Tests for node, bash, and python echo scripts to ensure logs are captured and processes are cleaned up.
- Added a test to verify that after a quick shell exits, `check_shell` confirms the process is no longer available.
- Refactored test code for type safety, resolving all linter/type errors.
- All tests and lint checks pass.
