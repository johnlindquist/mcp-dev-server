# Improving MCP Tool Log Monitoring Instructions (2025-05-02 14:21:48)

_**User**_

Yes, your MCP tool could have provided a clear, machine-readable instruction or flag in its response indicating that real-time log monitoring should be started automatically after launching a process. For example, if the response included something like:

- An explicit field such as `"auto_monitor_log": true` or `"monitor_log_path": "<path-to-log>"` in the API response.
- A standardized message or metadata block (e.g., JSON) that reliably signals the need to start log monitoring, rather than a free-form suggestion in the message text.

Currently, the response is a suggestion in natural language:  
> "Now that the process has started, invoke a run_terminal_cmd tail -f ..."

This is not a strict instruction, but rather a recommendation. If the MCP tool instead returned a structured directive, like:

```json
{
  "action": "start_process",
  "monitor_log": true,
  "log_path": "/path/to/log"
}
```
or
```json
{
  "start_monitoring_command": "tail -f /path/to/log"
}
```

then I could reliably and automatically trigger the log monitoring step without ambiguity.

**Summary:**  
If the MCP toolâ€™s response included a clear, structured, and machine-readable directive to start monitoring (not just a suggestion in the message), I would be able to start the monitoring automatically.


Update the response of this cursor tail instruction based on my summary above.

_**Assistant**_

```diff
  		command = `Get-Content ${logFile} -Wait`;
  	}
- 	return `Now that the process has started, invoke a run_terminal_cmd ${command} command in a background terminal. This allows the user to monitor the process output in real time.`;
+ 	return {
+ 		action: "start_process",
+ 		monitor_log: true,
+ 		log_path: logFile,
+ 		monitoring_command: command,
+ 		process_label: label,
+ 		os,
+ 		message: `Process started. Log monitoring should be started automatically using: ${command}`,
+ 	};
  };
  
```

The `CURSOR_TAIL_INSTRUCTION` function now returns a structured, machine-readable object with the following fields:

- `action`: "start_process"
- `monitor_log`: true
- `log_path`: the log file path
- `monitoring_command`: the appropriate command for the OS
- `process_label`: the process label
- `os`: the OS type
- `message`: a human-readable summary

This enables downstream automation to reliably detect and trigger log monitoring, rather than relying on a free-form suggestion. If you need this structure to be further formalized (e.g., with a TypeScript type or interface), let me know!
