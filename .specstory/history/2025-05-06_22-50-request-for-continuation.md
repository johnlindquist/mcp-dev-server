Okay, I will continue with the refactoring.

First, I'll focus on refactoring the payload construction logic in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`. I'll start by reading the content of this file to understand its current structure.

---

Read file: src/process/lifecycle.ts

---

I've reviewed `src/process/lifecycle.ts`. It appears that the main functions constructing payloads are `stopShell`, `startShell`, and `startShellWithVerification`.

I will now create a helper function, `createShellOperationResult`, in `src/mcpUtils.ts` to centralize the payload creation logic. This function will take the shell label, status, an optional message, and an optional PID, and return a `CallToolResult` object with the appropriate payload.

I'll start by reading `src/mcpUtils.ts` to see where to best place the new helper function.

---

Read file: src/mcpUtils.ts

---

Now I'll add the `createShellOperationResult` function to `src/mcpUtils.ts`.

---



---

Now I'll add the `createShellOperationResult` function to `src/mcpUtils.ts`.

I will place this new function after the existing `fail` function and before the `shape` function. This new function will simplify how results are constructed in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`.

---

Cancelled

I will place this new function after the existing `fail` function and before the `shape` function. This new function will simplify how results are constructed in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`.

It seems the previous attempt to add the `createShellOperationResult` function to `src/mcpUtils.ts` was interrupted. I'll try that again.

+ 	return result;
+ };
  
  export const shape = <T extends ZodRawShape>(x: T) => x;
```

---

Now that the `createShellOperationResult` helper function is in place, I will refactor `src/process/lifecycle.ts` to use it. I'll start with the `stopShell` function.

The `stopShell` function in `src/process/lifecycle.ts` has been refactored to use the `createShellOperationResult` helper. Additionally, the diff shows that the `startShell` and `startShellWithVerification` functions were also updated. This is great as it means the `edit_file` tool was able to apply the changes more broadly.

I will now run the tests to ensure that these changes haven't introduced any regressions.

---

The tests failed with TypeScript errors in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`. It seems I made a mistake in how I'm calling `createShellOperationResult` in a few places.

The errors are:
1. `src/process/lifecycle.ts:175:4 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.` This indicates I'm passing a boolean where a number (likely `pid`) is expected.
2. `src/process/lifecycle.ts:788:3 - error TS2367: This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '\"starting\" | \"running\" | \"verifying\" | \"stopped\" | \"crashed\" | \"restarting\" | \"stopping\"' and '\"error\"' have no overlap.` This means the `isError` flag is being set based on a comparison that will always be false.
3. `src/process/lifecycle.ts:945:3 - error TS2367: This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '\"starting\" | \"running\" | \"verifying\" | \"stopped\" | \"crashed\" | \"restarting\" | \"stopping\"' and '\"error\"' have no overlap.` Same as above.

I'll fix these errors in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`.

It seems the fix for the first error (`TS2345: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.`) at `src/process/lifecycle.ts:175:4` was not applied in the previous edit. The diff only shows changes for lines 788 and 945.

I'll try to fix that specific error again.

---



---

The previous attempt to fix the TypeScript error at `src/process/lifecycle.ts:175` by explicitly passing `pidToKill` to `createShellOperationResult` in the `catch` block of the `stopShell` function resulted in no changes being applied. This might mean the model believes the code is already correct or it couldn't find the exact spot.

To be sure, I'll read the relevant section of `src/process/lifecycle.ts` around line 175 to confirm the current state of the code.

---

Read file: src/process/lifecycle.ts

---

I've reviewed the code around line 175 in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`.

The `catch` block for the `stopShell` function (lines 257-269 in the latest snippet, which corresponds to the area around the original line 175 error) looks like this:

```typescript
// ...
} catch (error) {
    const errorMsg = `Error stopping shell ${label} (PID: ${pidToKill}): ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}`;
    log.error(label, errorMsg, "tool");
    addLogEntry(label, `Error stopping shell: ${errorMsg}`, "tool");
    finalMessage = `Error stopping shell: ${errorMsg}`;
    finalStatus = "error"; // Update status to error on exception
    updateProcessStatus(label, "error"); // Persist error state
    return createShellOperationResult(
        label,
        finalStatus,
        finalMessage,
        pidToKill, // This is correct, pidToKill is a number
        true,      // This is isError, a boolean
    );
}
// ...
```
The call to `createShellOperationResult` here is:
`createShellOperationResult(label, finalStatus, finalMessage, pidToKill, true)`

The definition of `createShellOperationResult` is:
`createShellOperationResult(label: string, status: string, message?: string, pid?: number, isError = false)`

The arguments seem to align correctly:
- `label` (string)
- `finalStatus` (string)
- `finalMessage` (string)
- `pidToKill` (number)
- `true` (boolean, for `isError`)

The TypeScript error `TS2345: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'` at `src/process/lifecycle.ts:175:4` (which is the `true` argument in the call above) suggests that the compiler *thinks* the 4th argument (`pid`) is receiving the boolean `true`, and the 5th argument (`isError`) is missing.

This is puzzling, as the code looks correct. It's possible there's a subtle issue or that the line numbers in the error message are slightly off, and the actual error is in a *different* call to `createShellOperationResult`.

Let's re-examine the other locations where `createShellOperationResult` is called within `stopShell`:

1.  Shell not found (around line 140-147):
    ```typescript
    if (!initialShellInfo) {
        return createShellOperationResult(
            label,
            "error", // Default status for not found
            `Shell \"${label}\" not found.`,
            undefined, // pid is undefined
            true,      // isError is true
        );
    }
    ```
    This looks correct. `undefined` is a valid value for an optional `pid?: number`.

2.  Process already terminal (around line 157-164):
    ```typescript
    return createShellOperationResult(
        label,
        initialShellInfo.status,
        PROCESS_ALREADY_TERMINAL(initialShellInfo.status),
        // initialShellInfo.pid, // Commented out, so pid is undefined
    ); // isError defaults to false
    ```
    This also looks correct. `pid` is `undefined` (due to the commented-out line), and `isError` will default to `false`.

3.  No active handle (around line 173-180):
    ```typescript
    return createShellOperationResult(
        label,
        "error",
        PROCESS_NO_ACTIVE_HANDLE,
        // initialShellInfo.pid, // Commented out, so pid is undefined
        true, // isError is true
    );
    ```
    This is where the original error was reported (line 175 was the `true`). If `initialShellInfo.pid` is commented out, then `pid` is `undefined`. The `true` is correctly for the `isError` parameter. This still seems correct.

Given the error `Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'`, the only place a boolean is passed where a number might be misinterpreted is if an earlier optional string argument (`message`) was `undefined`, causing `pidToKill` (a number) to be interpreted as the `message` and then `true` (a boolean) to be interpreted as the `pid`. However, `finalMessage` is always a string.

Perhaps the issue lies in how the `edit_file` tool applied the changes, or there's a caching issue with the TypeScript server.

To try and force a clear state, I will explicitly provide all arguments to `createShellOperationResult` in the problematic call within the `catch` block, even the default `isError`.

I'll apply this specific change.

---

```diff
  			finalMessage,
  			pidToKill, 
- 			true,
+ 			true,      // Explicitly setting isError to true
  		);
  	}
```

---

The change was applied, though it was minimal as the code was already very similar.

Let's try running the tests again to see if this has resolved the TypeScript error at line 175.

pnpm test

The same TypeScript errors persist. The error at `src/process/lifecycle.ts:175:4` (Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number') is still present, despite the code appearing correct.

The line numbers for the other two errors shifted slightly (`789` and `946`), but they are the same type of error (`This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types ... and '\"error\"' have no overlap`).

This is quite strange. Let's focus on the first error on line 175 again.
The code is:
```typescript
// In stopShell, inside the catch block
return createShellOperationResult(
    label,          // string
    finalStatus,    // string
    finalMessage,   // string
    pidToKill,      // number
    true,           // boolean for isError (this is line 175 according to the error)
);
```
The function signature is:
`createShellOperationResult(label: string, status: string, message?: string, pid?: number, isError = false)`

If line 175 is the `true` argument, TypeScript thinks this boolean `true` is being assigned to the `pid?: number` parameter. This would imply that `pidToKill` (the 4th argument) is somehow being interpreted as the `message?: string` (the 3rd argument).

This could happen if `finalMessage` was `undefined`. However, `finalMessage` is initialized as `""` and then assigned a string value: `finalMessage = Error stopping shell ${label} (PID: ${pidToKill}): ...`. So it should always be a string.

Could there be an overload of `createShellOperationResult` or a similarly named function that's causing confusion? I'll check `src/mcpUtils.ts` again.

Read file: src/mcpUtils.ts

There is only one definition for `createShellOperationResult` in `src/mcpUtils.ts`, and its signature matches what I've been working with:
`createShellOperationResult(label: string, status: string, message?: string, pid?: number, isError = false)`

The persistent TypeScript error `TS2345: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'` at `src/process/lifecycle.ts:175:4` is very confusing, as the arguments appear to be passed correctly.

Let's try to make the problematic call even more explicit by naming the arguments. This is not standard JS/TS syntax for function calls but can sometimes help clarify intent to the TypeScript compiler or language server, or at least make the error message more specific if it persists. However, since this isn't valid syntax, I can't directly use it in an `edit_file` call.

Could the `pidToKill` somehow be a boolean at that point?
`pidToKill` is initialized from `initialShellInfo.pid`.
`initialShellInfo` comes from `await checkAndUpdateProcessStatus(label)`.
`ShellInfo` (the type of `initialShellInfo`) has `pid?: number`.
So `pidToKill` should be `number | undefined`.

If `pidToKill` were `undefined`, the call would be `createShellOperationResult(label, finalStatus, finalMessage, undefined, true)`. This is valid.
If `pidToKill` were a number, the call is `createShellOperationResult(label, finalStatus, finalMessage, number, true)`. This is also valid.

The error is specifically that the `true` (which is the 5th argument, for `isError`) is being seen as the 4th argument (`pid`). This can only happen if the 3rd argument (`message`) is `undefined`, and the 4th argument (`pidToKill`) is also `undefined`.
Call: `createShellOperationResult(string, string, undefined, undefined, true)`
This would make TypeScript think `true` is for `pid`.

But `finalMessage` is set to `Error stopping shell ${label} (PID: ${pidToKill}): ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}`;. This will always be a string, never `undefined`.

I am genuinely stuck on why this specific error (TS2345 at line 175) is occurring. The code seems correct.

What if the issue is with the `textPayload(JSON.stringify(payload))` line *inside* `createShellOperationResult` when certain combinations of undefined `message` or `pid` occur?
```typescript
export const createShellOperationResult = (
    label: string,
    status: string,
    message?: string,
    pid?: number,
    isError = false,
): CallToolResult => {
    const payload: Record<string, unknown> = { // payload is Record<string, unknown>
        label,
        status,
    };
    if (message) { // If message is undefined, payload.message is not set
        payload.message = message;
    }
    if (pid !== undefined) { // If pid is undefined, payload.pid is not set
        payload.pid = pid;
    }
    const result = {
        // JSON.stringify will handle undefined properties by omitting them.
        content: [textPayload(JSON.stringify(payload))],
        isError,
    };
    return result;
};
```
This internal logic seems fine.

Perhaps there is a problem with the `tsconfig.json` or a Biome/TSC version mismatch that's leading to a confusing error message or incorrect type inference in this specific scenario.

Let's look at the other two errors again:
`src/process/lifecycle.ts:789:3 - error TS2367: This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '\"starting\" | \"running\" | \"verifying\" | \"stopped\" | \"crashed\" | \"restarting\" | \"stopping\"' and '\"error\"' have no overlap.`
This error is on the line: `finalShellInfo.status === "error", // isError if the final status is 'error'`
Here `finalShellInfo.status` is of type `ShellStatus`, which is defined as:
`export type ShellStatus = "starting" | "running" | "verifying" | "stopped" | "crashed" | "restarting" | "stopping";`
Indeed, `ShellStatus` does not include `"error"`. The `isError` flag in `createShellOperationResult` should be determined if the operation *resulted* in an error, not necessarily if the shell's *internal status* is literally the string "error".

If `finalShellInfo.status` can't be `"error"`, then `finalShellInfo.status === "error"` will always be `false`.
The intent is likely: `isError` should be true if the operation itself failed, or if the resulting shell status indicates a problematic state.

Let's adjust the logic for the `isError` flag in the return statements of `startShell` and `startShellWithVerification` (around lines 789 and 946).
The `stopShell` function's final return has `isError: finalStatus === "error" || (latestShellInfo?.status === "error")`. This also needs to be addressed.

It seems `ShellStatus` represents *active/valid* states, and "error" is a state managed separately or implicitly.
In `createShellOperationResult`, the `isError` parameter is distinct from the `status: string` in the payload.

The `status` field in the payload for `createShellOperationResult` can be `"error"`.
So, `finalShellInfo.status === "error"` would be comparing a `ShellStatus` type (which doesn't include "error") with the literal string "error". This is what TS is complaining about.

The fix is probably to ensure that when we pass a status to `createShellOperationResult`, if it's an error state, we pass the string `"error"`, and then the `isError` flag should be `true`.

Let's re-evaluate the return for `stopShell` first (around line 276):
Current:
```typescript
return createShellOperationResult(
    label,
    latestShellInfo?.status ?? finalStatus, // This can be a ShellStatus or "error" from finalStatus
    finalMessage,
    pidToKill,
    finalStatus === "error" || (latestShellInfo?.status === "error"), // Problematic comparison
);
```
If `latestShellInfo.status` is a `ShellStatus` (e.g. "stopped"), and `finalStatus` (which can be "error") is "error", then the `isError` flag becomes `true || (false)`, which is `true`. This seems okay.
The issue is `latestShellInfo?.status === "error"`. `latestShellInfo.status` is `ShellStatus`.

Revised logic for `stopShell`'s final return:
The `status` argument to `createShellOperationResult` should be `latestShellInfo?.status ?? finalStatus`. This is fine because `finalStatus` *can* be `"error"`.
The `isError` argument should be `true` if `(latestShellInfo?.status ?? finalStatus) === "error"`.

Let's apply this to all three problematic `isError` calculations.

1.  `stopShell` (final return, around line 276, error was at ~175 but the actual issue might be this final `isError` logic):
    `isError: (latestShellInfo?.status ?? finalStatus) === "error"`

2.  `startShell` (final return, error was at ~789):
    `isError: finalShellInfo.status === "error"` should become `isError: finalShellInfo.status === "error"` (this one seems like it should be fine if `finalShellInfo.status` can actually be "error", but TS says `finalShellInfo.status` is `ShellStatus`).

Let's check the type of `finalShellInfo.status` in `startShell` and `startShellWithVerification`.
In `startShell`, `finalShellInfo` comes from `getShellInfo(label)`. The `status` property of `ShellInfo` is `ShellStatus`. So `finalShellInfo.status === "error"` is indeed comparing `ShellStatus` with `"error"`.

The `status` that goes *into* the payload via `createShellOperationResult` can be `"error"`.
The `isError` flag for `CallToolResult` should reflect if the overall operation is an error.

It should be:
`isError: finalShellInfo.status === "crashed" || someOtherLogicIndicatingAnErrorInOperation`
No, simpler: if the status we are reporting in the payload is "error", then `isError` should be true.

Correct logic for `isError` in the success paths of `startShell` and `startShellWithVerification` (lines ~789, ~946):
The status being set in the payload is `finalShellInfo.status`. If this status *is* "error" (even if `ShellStatus` type doesn't list it, the actual value might be), then `isError` should be true.
The problem is that `finalShellInfo.status` is typed as `ShellStatus`, which *doesn't* include `"error"`.
However, the `status` field in `managedShells` *can* be set to `"error"` (e.g., `updateProcessStatus(label, "error")`).
So `getShellInfo(label)` *can* return a `ShellInfo` where `status` is actually `"error"`.

This means the TypeScript definition of `ShellStatus` might be incomplete or misleading if runtime values can be `"error"`.
`export type ShellStatus = "starting" | "running" | "verifying" | "stopped" | "crashed" | "restarting" | "stopping";`

If `updateProcessStatus(label, "error")` is called, then `managedShells.get(label).status` will be `"error"`.
So `getShellInfo(label).status` can indeed be `"error"`.
Why is TS complaining then? `finalShellInfo.status === "error"` should be a valid comparison if `finalShellInfo.status` can actually be `"error"`.

Could it be that `finalShellInfo` is not guaranteed to be non-null?
`const finalShellInfo = getShellInfo(label);`
If `finalShellInfo` is `undefined`, then `finalShellInfo.status` would be an error.
The code for `startShell` (around line 780):
```typescript
// ... inside try/catch/finally of startShell
const finalShellInfo = getShellInfo(label);
if (!finalShellInfo) {
    // ... return error ...
}
// ...
const successPayload = { /* ... message ... */ };
return createShellOperationResult(
    label,
    finalShellInfo.status, // TS knows finalShellInfo is not null here
    successPayload.message,
    finalShellInfo.pid,
    finalShellInfo.status === "error", // This is line ~789
);
```
Here, `finalShellInfo` is guarded by the `if (!finalShellInfo)` check. So `finalShellInfo.status` should be safe.
The problem remains: `finalShellInfo.status` (type `ShellStatus`) vs `"error"`.

The most robust way to set the `isError` flag for the result is: `resultPayloadStatus === "error"`.
So, for lines ~789 and ~946:
`isError: finalShellInfo.status === "error"`

And for `stopShell` (line ~276):
`isError: (latestShellInfo?.status ?? finalStatus) === "error"`

These comparisons *should* be valid if the status can indeed be "error" at runtime, despite `ShellStatus` definition.
The TS error `TS2367: This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types ... and '\"error\"' have no overlap` strongly suggests that, according to TS's current understanding (perhaps based on an imported or inferred type for `finalShellInfo.status` that *strictly* adheres to `ShellStatus`), the comparison is always false.

This could happen if `finalShellInfo.status` is somehow narrowed to `Exclude<ShellStatus, "error">` by TypeScript before the comparison.

Let's assume `ShellStatus` should indeed *not* include "error", and "error" is a special status used for the `CallToolResult` payload.
If `finalShellInfo.status` is truly only one of `ShellStatus` values, then comparing it to `"error"` is indeed always false.
Then `isError` should be based on other conditions.
- For `stopShell` successful path: `isError` should probably be `false` unless `finalStatus` (which *can* be "error") dictates it.
  - `isError: finalStatus === "error"` (since `latestShellInfo.status` cannot be "error" by this logic)
- For `startShell` successful path: `isError` should be `false` because if it were an error, it would have gone through an error path. If `finalShellInfo.status` is `crashed`, that's a valid (non-error) terminal state for the *operation*.

This interpretation makes the `isError` flag reflect the success/failure of the *tool operation itself*, not just the state of the shell.

Revised `isError` logic:
1.  `stopShell` (final return): `isError: finalStatus === "error"`. (If the operation itself had an error, `finalStatus` would be "error". If the shell stopped but is e.g. "crashed", that's not an operation error).
2.  `startShell` (final success return): `isError: false`. (It's a success path).
3.  `startShellWithVerification` (final success return): `isError: false`. (It's a success path).

This seems more consistent with the purpose of `CallToolResult.isError`.
The `status` in the payload can still be "crashed", "stopped", etc.

Now, back to the persistent error `TS2345: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'` at line 175 (the `true` in the `catch` block of `stopShell`).
`return createShellOperationResult(label, finalStatus, finalMessage, pidToKill, true)`
If `finalStatus` is `"error"`, `pidToKill` is a number. This is fine.
This error remains the most mysterious.

Is it possible that `biome check --write .` is not actually fixing the file before `tsc --noEmit` runs?
The output says `Checked 50 files in 14ms. Fixed 1 file.` but then `tsc` reports the error.

Let's try to simplify the call at line 175 drastically to see if it changes the error.
What if `pidToKill` is explicitly `undefined` in that specific error path?
`return createShellOperationResult(label, "error", "some error message", undefined, true)`
If this works, it means `pidToKill` is somehow problematic.

Original problematic line in `catch` of `stopShell`:
`return createShellOperationResult(label, finalStatus, finalMessage, pidToKill, true);`
`finalStatus` will be `"error"` here. `finalMessage` will be a string. `pidToKill` is `number`.

Let's try to fix the `isError` logic first for the two `TS2367` errors, then re-run tests. If the line 175 error persists, it's isolated.

Fixing TS2367 errors:
- In `startShell` success return: `isError` becomes `false`.
- In `startShellWithVerification` success return: `isError` becomes `false`.
- In `stopShell` success return: `isError` becomes `finalStatus === "error"`.

This is the third attempt to fix linter errors. If this fails, I will stop and ask.

```diff
  		finalMessage,
  		pidToKill,
- 		// isError if final status is error OR latestShellInfo.status is 'error'
- 		finalStatus === "error" || latestShellInfo?.status === "error",
+ 		finalStatus === "error", // isError if the operation's final determined status is an error
  	);
  }
```

```diff
  		successPayload.message,
  		finalShellInfo.pid,
- 		finalShellInfo.status === "error", // isError if the final status is 'error'
+ 		false, // This is a success path for the operation
  	);
  }
```

```diff
  		successPayload.message,
  		finalShellInfo.pid,
- 		finalShellInfo.status === "error", // isError if the final status is 'error'
+ 		false, // This is a success path for the operation
  	);
  }
```

The `isError` logic has been updated for the success paths of `stopShell`, `startShell`, and `startShellWithVerification`.

Now, I'll run the tests again. This is the third attempt to fix linter errors in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`. If this fails, I will stop and ask for guidance.

The good news is that the `TS2367` errors (unintentional comparison) are gone! This means the `isError` logic changes for the success paths were correct.

However, the `TS2345: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'` error at `src/process/lifecycle.ts:175:4` (specifically, the `true` argument in the `catch` block of `stopShell`) stubbornly persists.

The relevant code is:
```typescript
// In stopShell, inside the catch block (around line 170-176 in original file context)
// finalStatus is "error"
// finalMessage is a string
// pidToKill is a number
return createShellOperationResult(
    label,
    finalStatus,
    finalMessage,
    pidToKill,
    true,      // This is line 175, the 'true' for isError
);
```
And the function signature:
`createShellOperationResult(label: string, status: string, message?: string, pid?: number, isError = false)`

As this is the third attempt to fix linter errors on this file and this specific error remains, I need to stop and ask for your guidance.

How would you like to proceed with this persistent TypeScript error (`TS2345`) on line 175 of `src/process/lifecycle.ts`? The code appears to be correct according to the function signature, but `tsc` disagrees.

How would you like to proceed with this persistent TypeScript error (`TS2345`) on line 175 of `src/process/lifecycle.ts`? The code appears to be correct according to the function signature, but `tsc` disagrees.

The error suggests that the boolean `true` (passed as the 5th argument for `isError`) is being interpreted as the 4th argument (`pid`, which expects a number). This usually happens if the 3rd argument (`message`) was `undefined`, causing a shift. However, `finalMessage` (the 3rd argument in this call) is always a string in this context. `pidToKill` (the 4th argument) is typed as `number | undefined`.

This is quite puzzling. As a diagnostic step to understand how TypeScript is interpreting the call, we could try temporarily modifying the problematic call in the `catch` block of `stopShell` to explicitly pass `undefined` for the `pid` argument. This isn't the *solution*, as we do want to pass `pidToKill`, but it might tell us if `pidToKill` itself is the source of the confusion for the compiler.

If you agree, I can make this temporary change:
Change from:
`return createShellOperationResult(label, finalStatus, finalMessage, pidToKill, true);`
To:
`return createShellOperationResult(label, finalStatus, finalMessage, undefined, true);`

And then we can run the tests again. If the error at line 175 disappears, it isolates the issue to how `pidToKill` is handled or perceived in that specific call. If it persists, the mystery deepens.

What are your thoughts on this diagnostic step?
