Here’s what I found regarding the use of the `composer.addfilestocomposer` command in `keybindings.json` and whether people are adding arguments or using it in specific ways:

---

### 1. **No Direct Examples of `composer.addfilestocomposer` with Args in keybindings.json**

- There are **no public examples** on GitHub or in popular keybinding repositories of users adding arguments to `composer.addfilestocomposer` in their `keybindings.json`.
- The command is referenced in community discussions (e.g., [Cursor Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/key-binding-command-to-add-arbitrary-files-to-context/29687)), but users report that it only adds the currently open file and does **not** accept arguments for specifying files or folders.

### 2. **Workarounds and Feature Requests**

- Users have tried to use `runCommands` in `keybindings.json` to chain commands, such as:
  ```json
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+e",
    "command": "runCommands",
    "args": {
      "commands": [
        "composer.createNew",
        {
          "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen",
          "args": "<file_path>"
        },
        "workbench.action.acceptSelectedQuickOpenItem",
        "composer.addfilestocomposer"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  - This approach attempts to open a file and then
