# Improving startShell Response for AI Clarity (2025-05-04 12:51:45)

_**User**_

@startShell() 

So we need to work on the start shell response, like returning actions and making things super clear to the AIs which gets these responses, what they're supposed to do next. Currently it's returning an array. I think we need to remove the second item from the array, which turns out a string of opening the tail logs. Because I think we're covering that well in the action. I think we also need to add to the actions that if a URL was present, put in a proper markdown link. Again, these are instructions for the AI. I don't want you to actually write the code for it. I want you to tell this in English to the AI to do it. It should take any URLs detected in the logs, in the shell logs, displayed to the user. Remember, you're telling the AI, it's going to display this to the user, displayed to the user as clickable links. And maybe even give them, and then just like, look at the response of start shell. And let's work on making everything much more new branch for this work. Then figure out a plan for this. And then each time you come progress on it, start by creating the new branch, please.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a clear, step-by-step English instruction set for the AI, based on your requirements for improving the startShell response and the user/AI experience:

---

## Instructions for the AI (for startShell response handling)

1. **Single Response Only**:  
   Only use the first item in the response array from startShell. Ignore any additional string responses (such as those instructing to open tail logs), as all necessary actions will be included in the `actions` array of the response payload.

2. **Action Handling**:  
   When the `actions` array is present in the startShell response, follow the instructions in the array. For example, if there is a `run_terminal_cmd` action with a `tail_command`, execute that command to monitor the shell output.

3. **URL Detection and Display**:  
   - Scan all shell logs (the `shellLogs` array in the response) for any URLs.
   - For each URL found, display it to the user as a clickable markdown link.
   - If the URL is relevant (e.g., a local dev server, web UI, or dashboard), provide a clear, user-friendly label for the link (e.g., "Open Dev Server", "View Dashboard").
   - If multiple URLs are found, display each as a separate clickable link.

4. **Markdown Formatting**:  
   - When presenting URLs to the user, always use proper markdown link syntax:  
     `[Descriptive Label](https://example.com)`
   - Ensure the links are easy to find and understand in the output.

5. **User Guidance**:  
   - After displaying the links and running any required commands, provide a brief summary of what the user can do next (e.g., "You can monitor the logs above, or click the link to open the dev server in your browser.").

6. **Clarity and Observability**:  
   - Make sure all actions, links, and next steps are clearly visible and easy to follow for the user.
   - Avoid redundant or confusing output.

---

## Plan for Implementation

1. **Create a new branch** for this work (e.g., `feat/start-shell-ai-instructions`).
2. **Update the startShell response** to only return a single payload (remove the second string response).
3. **Enhance the actions array** to include markdown links for any URLs found in the shell logs.
4. **Update the AI instructions** (as above) to ensure URLs are displayed as clickable links and that the user is guided on what to do next.
5. **Test the new behavior** to ensure clarity, observability, and a smooth user experience.
6. **Iterate in small, reviewable commits** to maintain micro-milestones and easy rollbacks.

---

**Next Step:**  
I will now create a new branch for this work and proceed with the first micro-milestone.

---

```bash
git checkout -b feat/start-shell-ai-instructions
```

```
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main) git checkout -b feat/start-shell-ai-instructions
Switched to a new branch 'feat/start-shell-ai-instructions'
husky - DEPRECATED

Please remove the following two lines from .husky/post-checkout:

#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

They WILL FAIL in v10.0.0

➜  mcp-dev-server git:(main)
```

---

A new branch feat/start-shell-ai-instructions has been created for this work.

**Summary of the plan and next steps:**
- The startShell response will be updated to only return a single payload (removing the redundant string).
- The actions array will be enhanced to include markdown links for any URLs found in the shell logs.
- AI instructions will be updated to ensure URLs are displayed as clickable links and that the user is guided on what to do next.
- All changes will be made in small, reviewable commits to maintain micro-milestones and easy rollbacks.

Next, I will begin by updating the startShell response to remove the redundant second string and ensure only the structured payload is returned. After that, I will proceed to enhance the actions array and update the AI instructions as described.

There are currently no staged changes to commit, which means no code modifications have been made yet. The codebase is passing all tests and is in a clean state on the new branch feat/start-shell-ai-instructions.

**Next step:**  
I will proceed to make the actual code changes:
- Update the startShell response to only return a single payload (removing the redundant string).
- Prepare the logic for detecting URLs in shell logs and including them as markdown links in the actions array.

Once the changes are made, I will rerun the tests and commit the update. Let me know if you want to focus on a specific part of this next, or I will proceed with the startShell response update.

The feature is now complete and committed:

- startShell now returns a single payload (no extra string for cursor host).
- URLs detected in shell logs are included in the detected_urls field for the AI to render as markdown links.
- The actions array is strictly schema-compliant (only run_terminal_cmd actions).
- All tests pass, and the integration test was updated to match the new response structure.

This implementation ensures clarity and observability for both the AI and the user, and provides a clear, actionable response for shell startups, including markdown links for any URLs found in logs. No further input is needed—this task is fully complete and ready for review or further integration.

_**User**_

Alright, this is how the AI currently responds, which is very close. We still need to make it, um, can you look at the response payload and make it even more commanding to start that both the tail command and the URL links to happen every single time. So, so look at the start shell description and the zod schema, like a start params for that. Maybe that would help if we, um, make it more persuasive there, but also like look at the response type and see if there's anything else we can do to add to, um, really force the AI to running the, um, tail command.

+ # PR: Make AI instructions and schema for startShell response mandatory and explicit
+ 
+ ## Summary
+ 
+ This PR makes the AI instructions and schema descriptions for the startShell response much more commanding and explicit, ensuring the AI always:
+ - Runs the tail_command using the run_terminal_cmd tool to monitor shell output (MANDATORY, never optional)
+ - Displays every detected_urls entry as a clickable markdown link to the user (MANDATORY, never optional)
+ 
+ ### Key Changes
+ - **src/types/schemas.ts**: Updated the Zod schema for StartSuccessPayloadSchema to use imperative, mandatory language in the .describe() for `ai_instructions` and `actions` fields. The schema now makes it clear that the AI MUST always run the tail command and MUST always display detected URLs as markdown links.
+ - **src/process/lifecycle.ts**: The `ai_instructions` field in the startShell response is now dynamically generated to be extremely explicit and commanding, based on the presence of a tail command and/or detected URLs. The instructions use strong imperative language ("MANDATORY: ... Do not skip these steps.").
+ - **Lint/style fixes**: Addressed template literal lint warnings for string constants.
+ - **Tests**: All tests updated and passing, including integration tests for cursor-tail-instructions and lifecycle.
+ 
+ ### Result
+ - The AI is now unambiguously instructed (in both schema and runtime payload) to always run the tail command and always display detected URLs as markdown links, every time.
+ - The response payload and schema are now much more persuasive and robust, reducing ambiguity for downstream AI agents and improving user experience.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ This PR is ready for review and merge.

_**User**_

So we're very, very close now. We need to strongly emphasize that the tail command could be blocking, so it's critical that it's a background terminal.

The update is complete and pushed:

- The AI instructions and schema descriptions now strongly emphasize that the tail_command MUST be run in a BACKGROUND terminal, as it may be blocking.
- This is explicit in both the Zod schema and the runtime ai_instructions string.
- All tests pass, and the branch is pushed to the remote PR.

This ensures the AI cannot miss the critical requirement to run the tail command in a background terminal, preventing blocking issues and improving reliability for users. If you need further tweaks or want to review the PR, everything is ready!

So this is the current output, and I think we're kind of duplicating the instructions run the tail command. Actions array. Let's go ahead and get rid of the actions array for now, and then tests.

The actions array has been fully removed from the startShell response and schema, and all related logic and documentation have been updated. The verification fields (isVerificationEnabled, verificationPattern, verificationTimeoutMs) are preserved for test compatibility. All tests now pass, and the changes have been pushed to the remote branch.

**Summary of what was done:**
- Removed the actions array from both the Zod schema and the runtime startShell response.
- Cleaned up all logic and documentation related to actions.
- Preserved verification fields to ensure all tests pass.
- Successfully ran all tests and pushed the update to the remote branch.

The startShell response is now simpler and less redundant, with all instructions for the AI clearly in the ai_instructions field. If you need further adjustments or want to update the PR body, let me know!

- # PR: Make AI instructions and schema for startShell response mandatory and explicit
+ # PR: Remove actions array from startShell response and schema, preserve verification fields
  
  ## Summary
  
- This PR makes the AI instructions and schema descriptions for the startShell response much more commanding and explicit, ensuring the AI always:
- - Runs the tail_command using the run_terminal_cmd tool to monitor shell output (MANDATORY, never optional)
- - Displays every detected_urls entry as a clickable markdown link to the user (MANDATORY, never optional)
- 
- ### Key Changes
- - **src/types/schemas.ts**: Updated the Zod schema for StartSuccessPayloadSchema to use imperative, mandatory language in the .describe() for `ai_instructions` and `actions` fields. The schema now makes it clear that the AI MUST always run the tail command and MUST always display detected URLs as markdown links.
- - **src/process/lifecycle.ts**: The `ai_instructions` field in the startShell response is now dynamically generated to be extremely explicit and commanding, based on the presence of a tail command and/or detected URLs. The instructions use strong imperative language ("MANDATORY: ... Do not skip these steps.").
- - **Lint/style fixes**: Addressed template literal lint warnings for string constants.
- - **Tests**: All tests updated and passing, including integration tests for cursor-tail-instructions and lifecycle.
+ This PR finalizes the simplification of the startShell response:
+ - **Removes the actions array** from both the Zod schema and the runtime startShell response, eliminating redundancy and making the response easier for AIs to consume.
+ - **Preserves verification fields** (`isVerificationEnabled`, `verificationPattern`, `verificationTimeoutMs`) to ensure compatibility with all tests and downstream consumers.
+ - **Minor formatting improvements** for code clarity and consistency.
+ - **All tests pass** and the codebase is clean.
  
  ### Result
- - The AI is now unambiguously instructed (in both schema and runtime payload) to always run the tail command and always display detected URLs as markdown links, every time.
- - The response payload and schema are now much more persuasive and robust, reducing ambiguity for downstream AI agents and improving user experience.
+ - The startShell response is now simpler, with all imperative instructions for the AI in the `ai_instructions` field.
+ - No more duplicate or redundant action instructions.
+ - The branch is ready for review, merge, and automerge.

  See [`src/mcpUtils.ts`], [`src/toolImplementations.ts`], and [`tests/integration/test-helpers.ts`] for examples.
+ 
+ ## Key Concepts (2024)
+ 
+ - **Imperative AI Instructions:** The `ai_instructions` field in the response is now the single source of truth for what the AI must do next. It is always present and uses strong, explicit language (e.g., "MANDATORY: Immediately run the tail_command using your run_terminal_cmd tool in a BACKGROUND terminal to monitor this shell's output (the command may be blocking). You MUST also display every detected_urls entry as a clickable markdown link to the user. Do not skip these steps.").
+ - **No actions array:** The response no longer includes an `actions` array. All imperative instructions are in `ai_instructions`.
+ - **Background Terminal Required:** The AI must always run the `tail_command` in a background terminal, as it may be blocking. Never run it in the foreground.
+ - **URL Extraction:** Any URLs found in logs are returned in the `detected_urls` array. The AI must always display these as clickable markdown links to the user.
+ - **No Redundancy:** The response payload is simpler and less redundant, with all instructions for the AI in a single place.
+ - **Never Skip Steps:** The AI must never skip or delay running the tail command or displaying detected URLs as links.
  
  ## Tool Catalogue
```

```diff
  
  Response payload for a successful start_shell call. Contains fields like `label`, `status`, `pid`, `command`, `args`, `cwd`, `exitCode`, `signal`, `log_file_path`, `tail_command`, `message`, `logs`, `monitoring_hint`, `info_message`, and `detected_urls` (if any URLs are found in logs, the AI should extract and return them as markdown links).
- *   `instructions` (string, optional): If the `host` was specified as `"cursor"` and file logging is enabled, this field will contain a suggested instruction for the Cursor IDE, like starting a background terminal to run the `tail_command`.
+ *   `ai_instructions` (string, mandatory): The AI MUST always follow the instructions in this field. It will always tell the AI to run the `tail_command` in a BACKGROUND terminal (never in the foreground, as it may be blocking) and to display all `detected_urls` as clickable markdown links. The AI must never skip or delay these steps.
+ *   `user_hint` (string, optional): A user-facing hint about what to do next.
+ 
  On failure, returns an error object, potentially including `error`, `status`, `cwd`, `error_type`.
  
```

The README has been updated with the latest concepts:

- The startShell response no longer includes an actions array; all imperative instructions for the AI are in the ai_instructions field.
- The ai_instructions field is now mandatory and extremely explicit, instructing the AI to always run the tail_command in a BACKGROUND terminal (as it may be blocking) and to always display detected_urls as markdown links to the user.
- The response payload is simpler and less redundant, with all instructions in ai_instructions.
- The Tool Catalogue now notes that the AI MUST follow the ai_instructions field, run tail_command in a background terminal, and display detected_urls as markdown links.
- All references to the actions array have been removed.
- It is emphasized that the AI should never skip or delay these steps, and that tail_command is blocking and must be backgrounded.
