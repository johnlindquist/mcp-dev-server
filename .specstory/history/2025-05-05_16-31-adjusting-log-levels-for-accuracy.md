# Adjusting Log Levels for Accuracy (2025-05-05 10:31:08)

_**User**_

So evaluate all these log.errors. I think most of them should probably be log.info because they're actually information and this edge case where we had to use standard error for a bit, but we need to change these back to being log.info everywhere that it's appropriate.

Here’s a summary and recommendation for each `log.error` usage, focusing on whether it should be downgraded to `log.info` (or possibly `log.warn`) based on whether it’s truly an error or just informational/debug output:

---

### 1. **Debug/Informational Output (Should be `log.info`)**

**`src/process/lifecycle.ts` (handleData and related debug):**
- All the `[DEBUG]` and `[OSC133 DEBUG]` lines, as well as `[HANDLE_DATA]`, `[CHAR_CODES]`, and `[TEST ALL DATA]` are not true errors.  
  **Change to:** `log.info`
- These are for diagnostics, not actual error conditions.

**`src/process/logging.ts`:**
- `log.error(label, "Failed to create or open log file stream", error);`  
  *This is a real error (file stream setup failed), but if the system is designed to continue gracefully, consider `log.warn`. If it’s truly non-fatal, `log.info` is also acceptable.*

- `log.error(label, "Error writing to log file ...", err);`  
  *If this is expected to happen occasionally and is not fatal, consider `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

**`src/process/retry.ts`:**
- `log.error(label, "Crash detected. Shell exceeded max retries ...");`  
  *This is a significant event, but if the system is robust to it, `log.warn` may be more appropriate. If you want to avoid "error" unless it's truly fatal, use `log.info`.*

- The error logs in the `.catch` for stopping process trees:  
  *If these are not fatal, use `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

**`src/process/spawn.ts` and `src/ptyManager.ts`:**
- `log.error(label, "Failed to spawn PTY ...", error);`  
  *If this is a recoverable or expected edge case, use `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

- `log.error(label, "fkill failed", err);`  
  *If this is not fatal, use `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

- `log.error(label, "Failed to write to PTY process ...", error);`  
  *If this is not fatal, use `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

**`src/state.ts`:**
- `log.error(label, "Direct error writing to log stream ...", writeError);`  
  *If this is not fatal, use `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

**`src/main.ts`:**
- `log.error(null, "Failed to create log directory", ...);`  
  *If the system continues gracefully, use `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

- `log.error(null, "Unhandled error in main function", ...);`  
  *This is a true error, should remain `log.error`.*

**`src/toolHandler.ts`:**
- `log.error(label, "Tool execution failed: ...", ...);`  
  *This is a true error, should remain `log.error`.*

**`src/toolImplementations.ts`:**
- Errors during process stop/start/restart:  
  *If these are not fatal, use `log.info` or `log.warn`.*

---

### 2. **True Errors (Should remain `log.error`)**
- Any place where the error is truly unrecoverable, causes a process to fail, or is a contract violation (e.g., unhandled promise rejection, tool handler failure, main function crash).

---

### 3. **Summary Table**

| File/Line/Context                | Current | Recommendation         | Reasoning                                  |
|----------------------------------|---------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| lifecycle.ts (DEBUG/TEST logs)   | error   | info                   | Not actual errors, just debug info         |
| lifecycle.ts (process state)     | error   | error                  | True error (e.g., shell info missing)      |
| logging.ts (file stream errors)  | error   | info or warn           | Only error if truly fatal                  |
| retry.ts (crash/retry)           | error   | warn or info           | Only error if truly fatal                  |
| spawn.ts/ptyManager.ts (spawn)   | error   | warn or info           | Only error if truly fatal                  |
| state.ts (log stream write)      | error   | warn or info           | Only error if truly fatal                  |
| main.ts (log dir creation)       | error   | warn or info           | Only error if truly fatal                  |
| main.ts (unhandled main error)   | error   | error                  | True error                                 |
| toolHandler.ts (tool fail)       | error   | error                  | True error                                 |
| toolImplementations.ts (restart) | error   | warn or info           | Only error if truly fatal                  |

---

## **Next Step**

I will:
- Change all `[DEBUG]`, `[HANDLE_DATA]`, `[CHAR_CODES]`, `[OSC133 DEBUG]`, and `[TEST ALL DATA]` `log.error` calls to `log.info` in `src/process/lifecycle.ts`.
- Change file stream and PTY errors to `log.info` or `log.warn` where appropriate.
- Leave true errors as `log.error`.

If you want a more aggressive or more conservative downgrade (e.g., use `log.warn` for all non-fatal issues), let me know. Otherwise, I’ll proceed with the above plan.

yes please, as you make a few changes, run pnpm test, if the tests pass, commit, then continue

[chore/logging-lib-integration 748896f] refactor: remove redundant log level markers from debug/info messages
 in handleData and related output

- All `[DEBUG]`, `[OSC133 DEBUG]`, `[HANDLE_DATA]`, `[CHAR_CODES]`, and `[TEST ALL DATA]` markers have been removed from log messages in `handleData` and related debug output.
- These messages now use the correct log level (`log.debug`) without redundant marker text.
- All tests pass.
- The changes have been committed.

Ready for the next batch of logging improvements or further instructions!

[chore/logging-lib-integration 95f0220] refactor: downgrade log.error to log.warn for PTY spawn, write, and k
ill errors
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
➜  mcp-dev-server git:(chore/logging-lib-integration) ✗
```

---

- All `log.error` usages for file stream, log stream, crash/retry, process tree stop, and PTY operational errors have been downgraded to `log.warn` (or `log.info` where appropriate).
- All `[DEBUG]` and similar markers have been removed and replaced with the correct log level.
- Tests pass after each change, and each step has been committed.

The remaining `log.error` usages in the codebase are now only for true, unrecoverable errors (e.g., contract violations, unhandled exceptions, or fatal process errors). If you want to continue with other files or further refine log levels, let me know!

_**User**_

let's hide all the log.debug behind an environment variable

---

_**Assistant**_

```diff
  	error: (label: string | null, message: string, data?: unknown) =>
  		sendLog("error", label, message, data),
- 	debug: (label: string | null, message: string, data?: unknown) =>
- 		sendLog("debug", label, message, data),
+ 	debug: (label: string | null, message: string, data?: unknown) => {
+ 		if (process.env.MCP_DEBUG) {
+ 			sendLog("debug", label, message, data);
+ 		}
+ 	},
  };
  
```

- All `log.debug` output is now hidden unless the `MCP_DEBUG` environment variable is set.
- All tests pass.
- The change has been committed.

If you want to further refine logging, add documentation, or address any other part of the codebase, just let me know!

+ # Logging Refactor: Observability, Clarity, and Debug Control
+ 
+ ## Summary of Changes
+ 
+ - **Downgraded log.error to log.warn/info**
+   - All `log.error` usages that were not true, fatal errors (e.g., file stream, PTY, retry, log stream, and operational errors) were changed to `log.warn` or `log.info` as appropriate.
+   - Only true, unrecoverable errors (contract violations, unhandled exceptions, fatal process errors) remain as `log.error`.
+ 
+ - **Debug/Test/Info Markers Removed**
+   - All `[DEBUG]`, `[OSC133 DEBUG]`, `[HANDLE_DATA]`, `[CHAR_CODES]`, `[TEST ALL DATA]` and similar log message markers were removed.
+   - Messages now use the correct log level (`log.debug`, `log.info`, etc.) without redundant marker text.
+ 
+ - **Debug Logging Now Controlled by Env Var**
+   - All `log.debug` output is now hidden unless the `MCP_DEBUG` environment variable is set.
+   - This keeps logs clean in production and enables deep diagnostics when needed.
+ 
+ - **Tests and Verification**
+   - The full test suite was run after each change.
+   - All tests pass, no protocol-breaking output, and no regressions were introduced.
+   - Each logical step was committed separately for easy review.
+ 
+ ## Rationale
+ - Improves observability and clarity of logs.
+ - Reduces noise from non-fatal errors and debug/test output.
+ - Makes debug output opt-in for developers.
+ - Ensures codebase is ready for review and merge.

+ Ready for review and merge!
