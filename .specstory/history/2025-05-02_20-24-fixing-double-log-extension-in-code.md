# Fixing Double Log Extension in Code (2025-05-02 14:24:01)

_**User**_

Somewhere in the code base, we're appending like a double log dot log when generating the tail command. Can you find where that is and make sure to just remove that extra dot log off the end?

The source of the double `.log.log` was in `src/process/logging.ts`, where `.log` was being appended to the result of `sanitizeLabelForFilename(label)`, even though that function already adds `.log`. I have removed the extra `.log` in the log file path construction.

- The code now generates log file names with a single `.log` extension.
- The project builds and all tests pass, confirming the fix is correct and does not break anything.

This resolves the double `.log` issue for log file naming and tail command generation. If you need further adjustments or want to check for similar issues elsewhere, let me know!
