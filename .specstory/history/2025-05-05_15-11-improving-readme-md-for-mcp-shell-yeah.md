# Improving README.md for mcp-shell-yeah (2025-05-05 09:11:17)

_**User**_

@README.md 

Okay, incorporating your feedback about the "mcp-shell-yeah" branding and the specific problem it solves, here's the revised list of recommendations for improving your `README.md`:

**Revised README Improvement Plan for `mcp-shell-yeah`:**

1.  **Solidify Branding & Sharpen Introduction:**
    *   **Problem:** Current title/description mismatch (`mcp-pm` vs `mcp-shell-yeah`) and generic "background process" language. Doesn't clearly articulate the core pain point.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Rename:** Update the main title and all references to `mcp-shell-yeah`.
        *   **Rewrite Introduction:** Craft a compelling opening paragraph that defines the project and the problem it solves. Example draft:
            > **mcp-shell-yeah** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to solve a common challenge: the difficulty AI agents have reliably managing long-running local development tasks like servers, build watchers, or test runners. Often, these background shells need to persist *across multiple conversations*, and checking their status or logs requires fragile custom scripts or manual intervention. **mcp-shell-yeah** provides a standardized MCP interface, enabling AI agents to reliably start, monitor, retrieve logs from, and stop these crucial shell processes, streamlining AI-driven development workflows.
        *   **Focus:** Ensure the introduction highlights the *persistence across conversations* and the *replacement of ad-hoc solutions* as key benefits.

2.  **Streamline Features into "Key Capabilities":**
    *   **Problem:** Redundant "Features" and "Available Tools" lists, mixing high-level value with low-level API names.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   Remove the "Available Tools" list.
        *   Transform the "Features" list into a "Key Capabilities" section focused on the *solutions* provided:
            *   Start & Manage Long-Running Shells (Dev servers, tests, etc.)
            *   Maintain Shell State Across Conversations
            *   Check Real-time Status (Running, Crashed, Stopped?)
            *   Access Shell Output Logs Reliably
            *   Stop Specific Shells or All Managed Shells
            *   Send Input to Interactive Shells

3.  **Relocate Detailed API Documentation:**
    *   **Problem:** The "Tool Catalogue" contains excessive implementation details (parameters, JSON structures) unsuitable for a primary README.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Move:** Transfer the entire "Tool Catalogue" section to a separate `API.md` or `docs/TOOLS.md` file.
        *   **Link:** Add a clear link in the main README (e.g., under "Key Capabilities" or a new "API Reference" section) pointing to the detailed API documentation for developers integrating with `mcp-shell-yeah` (like agent developers).

4.  **Isolate Developer-Specific Content:**
    *   **Problem:** Sections like "Development Setup" notes, "MCP Compliance," and "Key Concepts (2024)" contain internal implementation details not relevant for end-users.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Simplify "Development Setup":** Retain only the essential steps (clone, install, build, run) for potential contributors.
        *   **Move Internal Notes:** Relocate notes about modularization, testing strategy, MCP implementation specifics (`ai_instructions`, SDK usage), etc., to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or the API documentation file. A brief mention of MCP compliance in the main README is sufficient.

5.  **Add Clear Use Cases:**
    *   **Problem:** Lack of concrete examples illustrating how `mcp-shell-yeah` solves the stated problems.
    *   **Suggestion:** Include a concise "Common Use Cases" section:
        *   Starting a `npm run dev` server and letting the AI check its logs later or in a new chat.
        *   Running `npm run test:watch` and having the AI monitor for test failures across interactions.
        *   Initiating a long `build` command and checking its completion status afterwards.
        *   Asking the AI to restart a specific dev server that seems stuck.

6.  **Position "Known Limitations" Appropriately:**
    *   **Problem:** Important information, but potentially distracting if placed too early.
    *   **Suggestion:** Keep this section to manage user expectations (especially regarding PTY prompt capture), but place it towards the end of the README, after the core usage and capabilities are explained.

7.  **Optimize Information Flow:**
    *   **Problem:** The current structure mixes information for different audiences (end-users, integrators, contributors).
    *   **Suggestion:** Adopt a user-centric flow:
        1.  `mcp-shell-yeah` Title & Enhanced Introduction (What & Why, Problem/Solution)
        2.  Quick Start / Add to Cursor (Primary user action)
        3.  Key Capabilities (What it enables the AI to do)
        4.  Common Use Cases (Practical examples)
        5.  Link to API Reference / Tool Details (For agent developers)
        6.  Known Limitations
        7.  Development Setup (Brief, for contributors)
        8.  Technology Stack

By following these revised steps, focusing on the `mcp-shell-yeah` branding and the core problem of managing persistent dev tasks for AI, the README will be significantly clearer and more effective.

+ 
+ ## Tool Catalogue
+ 
+ ### `start_shell`
+ 
+ Starts a background process (like a dev server or script) and manages it.
+ 
+ **Parameters:**
+ 
+ *   `command` (string, required): The command to execute.
+ *   `workingDirectory` (string, required): The absolute working directory to run the command from. This setting is required. Do not use relative paths like '.' or '../'. Provide the full path (e.g., /Users/me/myproject).
+ *   `label` (string, optional): Optional human-readable identifier (e.g. 'dev-server'). Leave blank to let the server generate one based on CWD and command.
+ *   `args` (array of strings, optional, default: `[]`): Optional arguments for the command.
+ *   `host` (string, optional, enum: `"cursor"`, `"claude"`, `"chatgpt"`, `"vscode"`, `"windsurf"`, `"unknown"`, default: `"unknown"`): Identifier for the client initiating the process. Helps tailor responses or instructions.
+ 
+ **Returns:** (JSON)
+ 
+ Response payload for a successful start_shell call. Contains fields like `label`, `status`, `pid`, `command`, `args`, `cwd`, `exitCode`, `signal`, `log_file_path`, `tail_command`, `message`, `logs`, `monitoring_hint`, `info_message`, and `detected_urls` (if any URLs are found in logs, the AI should extract and return them as markdown links).
+ *   `ai_instructions` (string, mandatory): The AI MUST always follow the instructions in this field. It will always tell the AI to run the `tail_command` in a BACKGROUND terminal (never in the foreground, as it may be blocking) and to display all `detected_urls` as clickable markdown links. The AI must never skip or delay these steps.
+ *   `user_hint` (string, optional): A user-facing hint about what to do next.
+ 
+ On failure, returns an error object, potentially including `error`, `status`, `cwd`, `error_type`.
+ 
+ **Example Usage:**
+ 
+ ```json
+ {
+   "command": "npm",
+   "args": ["run", "dev"],
+   "workingDirectory": "/path/to/my-web-app",
+   "label": "webapp-dev-server",
+   "host": "cursor"
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### `start_shell_with_verification`
+ 
+ Starts a background process with verification (pattern, timeout, retries).
+ 
+ **Parameters:**
+ 
+ *   `command` (string, required): The command to execute.
+ *   `workingDirectory` (string, required): The absolute working directory to run the command from. This setting is required. Do not use relative paths like '.' or '../'. Provide the full path (e.g., /Users/me/myproject).
+ *   `label` (string, optional): Optional human-readable identifier (e.g. 'dev-server'). Leave blank to let the server generate one based on CWD and command.
+ *   `args` (array of strings, optional, default: `[]`): Optional arguments for the command.

+ *   `verification_pattern` (string, optional): Optional regex pattern to match in stdout/stderr to verify successful startup. e.g., 'running on port 3000' or 'localhost'.
+ *   `verification_timeout_ms` (integer, optional, default: -1): Milliseconds to wait for the verification pattern. -1 disables the timer (default).
+ *   `retry_delay_ms` (integer, optional): Optional delay before restarting a crashed process in milliseconds (default: 1000ms).
+ *   `max_retries` (integer, optional): Optional maximum number of restart attempts for a crashed process (default: 3). 0 disables restarts.
+ 
+ **Returns:** (JSON)

+ *   `instructions` (string, optional): If the `host` was specified as `"cursor"` and file logging is enabled, this field will contain a suggested instruction for the Cursor IDE, like starting a background terminal to run the `tail_command`.
+ On failure, returns an error object, potentially including `error`, `status`, `cwd`, `error_type`.
+ 
+ **Example Usage:**
+ 
+ ```json
+ {
+   "command": "npm",
+   "args": ["run", "dev"],
+   "workingDirectory": "/path/to/my-web-app",
+   "label": "webapp-dev-server",

+ 
+ ## Known Limitations: Interactive Prompt Capture
+ 
+ Some interactive prompts (notably from bash and python scripts) may not be captured in PTY logs, even with all known workarounds (e.g., stdbuf, script, unbuffered environment variables). This is due to OS-level and language-level output buffering that cannot always be bypassed from the outside.
+ 
+ - **Node.js-based prompts are reliably captured.**
+ - **Echo/output from all languages is reliably captured.**
+ - If you need to ensure prompts are visible to the process manager, prefer Node.js-based CLIs or ensure your tool flushes output explicitly.
+ - This is a fundamental limitation of PTY and buffering behavior, not a bug in the process manager.
+ 
+ ## Known Limitations: Node.js Readline Prompts and PTY Capture
+ 
+ **Node.js readline prompts may not appear in logs or be detected as input-waiting prompts.**
+ 
+ - The Node.js `readline` library sometimes writes prompts directly to the terminal device, not through the process's stdout stream.
+ - In PTY-based process managers, this means the prompt may not be visible in logs or trigger prompt detection heuristics.
+ - This is a well-documented limitation of Node.js readline and PTY interaction ([see Node.js issue #29589](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/29589)).
+ - All other prompt types (bash, python, node custom CLI, etc.) are captured and detected correctly.
+ - If you do not see a prompt in logs, it is almost always because the program did not actually print one (or it used an escape sequence your parser ignores).
+ 
+ **Test Coverage:**
+ - The integration test for Node.js readline prompt detection is included but skipped, to document this limitation and catch any future improvements in PTY or Node.js behavior.
+ 
+ ## Known Limitation: OSC 133 Prompt Detection on macOS
+ 
+ - On macOS (bash 3.2), emitting raw OSC 133 prompt sequences (e.g., `\x1b]133;B\x07`) from the shell is not reliable.
+ - Even with direct `printf` or shell prompt configuration, the expected escape sequence does not appear in the PTY buffer.
+ - This is a limitation of the shell/environment, not the detection logic.
+ - As a result, OSC 133-based prompt detection tests are skipped, with detailed comments in the test file.
+ - Heuristic prompt detection (e.g., lines ending with `:`, `?`, etc.) is used as a fallback and is sufficient for most interactive CLI use cases.
+ - If you need robust OSC 133 detection, consider running tests in a Linux environment with a newer bash or zsh shell.
