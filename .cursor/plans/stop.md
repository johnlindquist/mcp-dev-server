Okay, let's think through the implications of defaulting `force: true` for `stop_process`.

You're right that in many development scenarios, especially with complex dev servers (like Next.js, Vite, etc.) that manage child processes or have intricate watch mechanisms, `SIGTERM` (the default signal sent when `force: false`) is often ignored or doesn't result in a clean shutdown within a reasonable timeframe. This leads to the need for `force: true` (`SIGKILL`).

**Arguments for Defaulting `force: true`:**

1.  **Reliability for Common Cases:** As you observed, many target processes for this tool (dev servers, watchers) don't respond well to `SIGTERM`. Defaulting to `SIGKILL` makes the stop action more consistently *work* from the perspective of the agent calling the tool.
2.  **Simplicity for the Agent:** The agent doesn't need to guess whether `force: true` is needed; it just calls `stop_process`, and the process is highly likely to terminate.
3.  **Speed:** `SIGKILL` is immediate. No waiting for the process to potentially clean up.

**Arguments Against Defaulting `force: true` (Reasons to Keep `force: false` Default):**

1.  **Loss of Graceful Shutdown:** `SIGTERM` gives a process the *chance* to shut down cleanly. This might involve:
    *   Saving state to disk.
    *   Closing network connections properly.
    *   Deleting temporary files.
    *   Notifying other systems.
    *   Allowing child processes to terminate gracefully.
    `SIGKILL` prevents *all* of this. The process is terminated instantly by the kernel.
2.  **Data Corruption/Loss:** For processes that *do* handle `SIGTERM` to save data, defaulting to `SIGKILL` guarantees that saving won't happen, potentially leading to data loss or corruption (e.g., a database write interrupted mid-transaction, a log file not flushed).
3.  **Orphaned Resources:** While less common in typical dev server scenarios, a forced kill might leave temporary files, lock files, or other resources behind that a graceful shutdown would have cleaned up.
4.  **Standard Practice:** The conventional approach in Unix-like systems is to try `SIGTERM` first, wait a bit, and *then* resort to `SIGKILL` if the process doesn't terminate. Defaulting straight to `SIGKILL` goes against this convention.
5.  **Debugging:** A process abruptly disappearing via `SIGKILL` can sometimes be harder to debug than one that logs errors during a failed `SIGTERM` shutdown attempt.

**Conclusion & Recommendation:**

While defaulting to `force: true` would make stopping *stubborn* dev servers more reliable with a single call, it universally prevents *any* process from attempting a graceful shutdown.

**A potentially better approach would be to implement the standard "try graceful, then force" pattern *within* the `_stopProcess` function itself when `force: false` is called:**

1.  **Keep Default `force: false`:** The API user signals intent for a normal stop.
2.  **Inside `_stopProcess(label, force=false)`:**
    *   Send `SIGTERM`.
    *   Wait for a short duration (e.g., using the existing `STOP_WAIT_DURATION` constant, currently 3 seconds).
    *   Check if the process has terminated (e.g., using `doesProcessExist` or by listening to the `onExit` event for that duration).
    *   If it hasn't terminated after the wait, *then* send `SIGKILL`.
3.  **Inside `_stopProcess(label, force=true)`:**
    *   Send `SIGKILL` immediately.

**Benefits of this approach:**

*   **Best of Both Worlds:** Attempts graceful shutdown first, respecting processes that handle `SIGTERM`.
*   **Guaranteed Termination:** Ensures the process eventually stops, even if `SIGTERM` is ignored.
*   **Simple API:** The user/agent usually just calls `stop_process` without `force: true` and gets the desired outcome (process stops). They only need `force: true` if they want an *immediate* kill without attempting graceful shutdown.
*   **Aligns with Conventions:** Follows standard process management practices.

**Therefore, I'd recommend against changing the default to `force: true`. Instead, I recommend enhancing the `_stopProcess` function to implement the SIGTERM -> Wait -> SIGKILL logic when `force` is false.**

This provides robustness without sacrificing the possibility of clean shutdowns for well-behaved processes.

If you still prefer the simplicity of defaulting to `force: true` despite the downsides, you would need to:

1.  Change the `default(false)` to `default(true)` in the `StopProcessParams` Zod schema within `src/toolDefinitions.ts`.
2.  Consider if `stopAllProcessesImpl` and `restartProcessImpl` (which currently call `_stopProcess(label, false)`) should also implicitly use the new forceful default, or if they should be updated to explicitly pass `force: false` if you want *them* to attempt graceful shutdown first.
