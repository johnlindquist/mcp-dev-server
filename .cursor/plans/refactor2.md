**Suggesting code improvements**

The user wants help improving a Node/TypeScript project, "mcp-dev-server," by organizing and cleaning up the code. The goal is to tackle duplication and improve structure, especially with multiple developers involved. I‚Äôll focus on high-level refactoring and suggest the top five changes, like breaking down large files into smaller ones, eliminating duplicated code, modularizing common functions, improving naming conventions, and enhancing code readability. I'll aim to provide practical ideas to make the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.


Thought for 11 seconds


Below is the ‚Äúbig-bang-for-the-buck‚Äù clean-up list‚Äîyou tidy these five areas and the repo will feel 10 lbs lighter overnight. I‚Äôve called out the pain, why it matters, and the concrete next step for each fix.

---

### 1. **Stop copy-pasting types‚Äîcreate a *single* `@/types` package**

**What‚Äôs wrong now?**

* `HostEnum`, `ProcessStatus`, `ProcessInfo`, `LogEntry`, `CallToolResult`, and multiple Zod schemas appear in **`types.ts`**, **`toolDefinitions.ts`**, **`toolImplementations.ts`**, and inline in tests.
* Every duplicate drifts (see `HostEnum` clash in `types.ts` vs `toolDefinitions.ts`).

**Why care?**
Type drift = bogus runtime bugs + broken auto-imports + slower refactors.

**Fix in two steps**

1. `src/types/`

   * `index.ts`   ‚Üê exports primitives (`TextContent`, `AudioContent`, ‚Ä¶) and **only** language-agnostic types.
   * `process.ts` ‚Üê process domain types (`ProcessInfo`, `ProcessStatus`, etc.).
   * `schemas.ts` ‚Üê **all** Zod schemas; nothing else.
2. Replace scattered imports with `import { ProcessInfo } from "@/types/process"` (VS Code auto-fix handles 90 %).

> *Side perk:* Tests can now import the *exact* runtime schema and avoid re-declaring interfaces.

### 2. **Carve up the 1 k-line `processLogic.ts` into a ‚Äúhexagonal‚Äù slice**

**What‚Äôs wrong now?**
`processLogic.ts` owns spawning, verification, logging, retry, settle-detection, exit-handling‚Äîevery concern in one bowling ball.

**Why care?**
File is nearly unreviewable; two devs edited the same functions with conflicting style comments.

**Fix roadmap**

```
src/process/
  spawn.ts           // spawnPtyProcess wrapper + sanitize env
  verify.ts          // _waitForVerification() & log-settle logic
  logging.ts         // addLogEntry, file-stream helpers
  lifecycle.ts       // start, stop, restart public API (thin)
  retry.ts           // back-off & crash-loop logic
```

* `lifecycle.ts` orchestrates the others‚Äîno business logic lives in tools anymore.
* Unit-test each slice head-less: pass in fake `IPty`, fake timers‚Äîno more mammoth integration tests just to exercise a branch.

---

### 3. **Centralize ‚Äúconst litter‚Äù in `src/constants` and export a typed config object**

**What‚Äôs wrong now?**
Same numeric literals live in `constants.ts`, `processLogic.ts`, and `toolImplementations.ts` (e.g., `DEFAULT_LOG_LINES`, fast-mode helpers).

**Why care?**
Tweaking a timeout means three pulls, three reviews, three merge conflicts.

**Fix**

* Turn `constants.ts` into:

```ts
// src/constants/index.ts
export const cfg = {
  maxStoredLogLines: 1000,
  defaultReturnLogLines: 50,
  stopWaitMs: ms(3000, 150),
  // ‚Ä¶
} as const;
```

* Import `cfg` everywhere; IDE will auto-complete and prevent stringly-typed keys.

---

### 4. **Extract the JSON-RPC test harness into `tests/helpers`**

**What‚Äôs wrong now?**
`tests/integration/mcp-server.test.ts` contains a 600-line kitchen-sink harness (`sendRequest`, verbose logging toggles, startup retries).

**Why care?**
Every future test re-copies the helpers or imports from a deep relative path.

**Fix**

1. `tests/helpers/serverHarness.ts`

   * `startServer(fastMode?: boolean)` ‚Üí returns `{ proc, sendRpc, kill }`.
   * Re-export `sendRpc` with built-in timeout and JSON parsing‚Äîtests only assert payloads.
2. Each spec becomes <100 lines; parallel runs use their own temp ports/PIDs.

---

### 5. **Kill the two-headed logging dragon**

**What‚Äôs wrong now?**

* There‚Äôs a verbose `log` object in **`utils.ts`**, but **`state.ts`** and **`processLifecycle.ts`** re-implement their own `log.warn/info`.
* ANSI-stripping helpers (`stripAnsiSafe`, `stripAnsiAndControlChars`) exist twice with slightly different regexes.

**Why care?**
Log spam is already noisy; duplicate helpers guarantee inconsistent scrub rules.

**Fix**

* New folder `src/log/`

  * `logger.ts` ‚Äî‚Äî tiny wrapper that injects `[mcp-pm]` prefix & handles ANSI trim.
  * `ansi.ts` ‚Äî‚Äî *single* source of truth for ANSI/CTRL stripping.
* Replace all imports via codemod:
  `import { log } from "@/log/logger";`

---

## Next move?

1. Create a `refactor/` branch.
2. Run `pnpm run verify` after each bullet above‚Äîtests should stay üçè.
3. Ship the branch behind a PR titled **‚ÄúFoundation cleanup: no-behavior-change‚Äù** so reviewers know it‚Äôs safe.
