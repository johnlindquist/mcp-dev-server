# Cursor Tail Instructions: Key Rules

1. If `host` is `"cursor"`, always include a strong tail command message in the MCP result (see [lifecycle.ts](mdc:src/process/lifecycle.ts)).
2. All tool results and tests must use MCP-compliant result/content types from [`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js`](mdc:package.json).
3. Keep tests fun-sized: extract feature-specific tests (like cursor-tail) into their own files (see [process-cursor-tail-instructions.test.ts](mdc:tests/integration/process-cursor-tail-instructions.test.ts)).
