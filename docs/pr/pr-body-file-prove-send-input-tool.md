# PR: Improve send_input Tool Feedback and Integration Test Robustness

## Motivation
- The `send_input` tool previously returned only a success message after sending input to a shell, without confirming what effect the input had.
- Users and automated agents need immediate, meaningful feedback about the process state and logs after input is sent.

## Implementation
- Updated `sendInputImpl` to wait 1 second after sending input, then call `checkProcessStatusImpl` and return the result (including logs and status).
- Ensured the required `log_lines` parameter is always passed to `checkProcessStatusImpl`.
- Added excessive logging for observability and micro-milestones for maintainability.

## Integration Tests
- Added a new integration test to verify that `send_input` returns the result of a `check_shell` call after input is sent.
- Refactored all relevant integration tests to assert on the returned logs and status from `send_input`.
- Addressed PTY/shell output timing issues (especially on macOS/bash) by implementing a polling loop in the test: after sending input, the test polls up to 10 times (100ms apart) for the expected output in logs, breaking early if found. This avoids adding a fixed wait and makes the test robust and fast.

## Documentation
- Updated the README to document the new behavior of `send_input`, including a code snippet from the integration test.

## Known Limitations
- PTY and shell output may not be immediately available after input due to OS and shell buffering, especially on macOS/bash. The polling approach in the test mitigates this without introducing unnecessary delay.
- The only log guaranteed to be present immediately is the `[MCP_INPUT] ...` entry, but the test now robustly checks for actual shell output.

## Commits
- `test: add integration test for send_input returning check_shell result (79dd650)`
- `refactor: ensure all send_input integration tests assert on returned logs/status (2f74a6c)`
- `docs: document send_input integration test behavior in README (dc704ce)`
- `fix: pass required log_lines param to checkProcessStatusImpl in sendInputImpl (c0fa9a1)`

## Summary
This PR ensures that `send_input` provides actionable feedback by returning the process status and logs after input, and that integration tests are robust to platform timing issues. The approach is fast, reliable, and well-documented for both users and contributors.
